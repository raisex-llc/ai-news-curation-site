Previous approaches have primarily focused on aligning visual and semantic representations but often overlooked the importance of fine-grained action patterns in the semantic space (e.g., the hand movements in drinking water and brushing teeth). To address these limitations, we propose a Frequency-Semantic Enhanced Variational Autoencoder (FS-VAE) to explore the skeleton semantic representation learning with frequency decomposition. FS-VAE consists of three key components: 1) a frequency-based enhancement module with high- and low-frequency adjustments to enrich the skeletal semantics learning and improve the robustness of zero-shot action recognition; 2) a semantic-based action description with multilevel alignment to capture both local details and global correspondence, effectively bridging the semantic gap and compensating for the inherent loss of information in skeleton sequences; 3) a calibrated cross-alignment loss that enables valid skeleton-text pairs to counterbalance ambiguous ones, mitigating discrepancies and ambiguities in skeleton and text features, thereby ensuring robust alignment. Evaluations on the benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, validating that frequency-enhanced semantic features enable robust differentiation of visually and semantically similar action clusters, improving zero-shot action recognition.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.22039v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have achieved remarkable success through large-scale pretraining. However, their design primarily targets real-valued series, limiting their ability to handle general forecasting tasks involving diverse and often heterogeneous covariates--such as categorical variables and multimodal data (e.g., images, text)--which are typically task-specific and difficult to leverage during pretraining. To address this gap, we propose Unified Covariate Adaptation (UniCA), a framework to bridge TSFMs with general covariate-aware forecasting. UniCA first performs covariate homogenization to transform heterogeneous covariates into high-level homogeneous series representations and then fuses them via a unified attention-based fusion mechanism. UniCA is compatible and universal for adaptation with both homogeneous and heterogeneous covariates, incorporating extra covariate information while preserving the generalization ability of TSFMs.Extensive experiments on multiple unimodal and multimodal covariate-aware forecasting benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of UniCA, highlighting the promise of covariate-aware TSFM adaptation in real-world forecasting scenarios.

Despite significant research efforts, existing approaches often degrade severely due to the joint effect of heterogeneity and partial client participation. In particular, while momentum appears as a promising approach for overcoming statistical heterogeneity, in current approaches its update is biased towards the most recently sampled clients. As we show in this work, this is the reason why it fails to outperform FedAvg, preventing its effective use in real-world large-scale scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel Generalized Heavy-Ball Momentum (GHBM) and theoretically prove it enables convergence under unbounded data heterogeneity in cyclic partial participation, thereby advancing the understanding of momentum's effectiveness in FL. We then introduce adaptive and communication-efficient variants of GHBM that match the communication complexity of FedAvg in settings where clients can be stateful. Extensive experiments on vision and language tasks confirm our theoretical findings, demonstrating that GHBM substantially improves state-of-the-art performance under random uniform client sampling, particularly in large-scale settings with high data heterogeneity and low client participation.

Recent research has been dedicated to data efficiency, which aims to maximize performance by selecting a minimal or optimal subset of training data. Techniques such as data filtering, sampling, and selection play a crucial role in this area. To complement it, we define Data Efficacy, which focuses on maximizing performance by optimizing the organization of training data and remains relatively underexplored. This work introduces a general paradigm, DELT, for considering data efficacy in LM training, which highlights the significance of training data organization. DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data Selection, and Data Ordering. Among these components, we design Learnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), as a new instance of Data Scoring, which considers both the learnability and quality of each data sample from the gradient consistency perspective. We also devise Folding Ordering (FO), as a novel instance of Data Ordering, which addresses issues such as model forgetting and data distribution bias. Comprehensive experiments validate the data efficacy in LM training, which demonstrates the following: Firstly, various instances of the proposed DELT enhance LM performance to varying degrees without increasing the data scale and model size. Secondly, among these instances, the combination of our proposed LQS for data scoring and Folding for data ordering achieves the most significant improvement. Lastly, data efficacy can be achieved together with data efficiency by applying data selection. Therefore, we believe that data efficacy is a promising foundational area in LM training.",

This study investigates the extent to which existing tools support AI-augmented data quality management (DQM) in data warehouse environments. To this end, we conduct a systematic review of 151 DQ tools to evaluate their automation capabilities, particularly in detecting and recommending DQ rules in data warehouses -- a key component of modern data ecosystems. Using a multi-phase screening process based on functionality, trialability, regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR), and architectural compatibility with data warehouses, only 10 tools met the criteria for AI-augmented DQM. The analysis reveals that most tools emphasize data cleansing and preparation for AI, rather than leveraging AI to improve DQ itself. Although metadata- and ML-based rule detection techniques are present, features such as SQL-based rule specification, reconciliation logic, and explainability of AI-driven recommendations remain scarce. This study offers practical guidance for tool selection and outlines critical design requirements for next-generation AI-driven DQ solutions -- advocating a paradigm shift from ``data quality for AI'' to ``AI for data quality management''.",

To this end, we conduct a systematic review of 151 DQ tools to evaluate their automation capabilities, particularly in detecting and recommending DQ rules in data warehouses -- a key component of modern data ecosystems. Using a multi-phase screening process based on functionality, trialability, regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR), and architectural compatibility with data warehouses, only 10 tools met the criteria for AI-augmented DQM. The analysis reveals that most tools emphasize data cleansing and preparation for AI, rather than leveraging AI to improve DQ itself. Although metadata- and ML-based rule detection techniques are present, features such as SQL-based rule specification, reconciliation logic, and explainability of AI-driven recommendations remain scarce. This study offers practical guidance for tool selection and outlines critical design requirements for next-generation AI-driven DQ solutions -- advocating a paradigm shift from ``data quality for AI'' to ``AI for data quality management''.",

DNAs are a natural generalization of the sparse methods such as Mixture-of-Experts, Mixture-of-Depths, parameter sharing, etc. Computation and communication patterns of DNA modules are learnt end-to-end during training and depend on the content and context of each token (or patch). These patterns can be shaped by further requirements added to the optimization objective such as compute/memory efficiency or load balancing. We empirically show that (i) trained DNAs are competitive with the dense baselines in both domains and (ii) compute efficiency/parameter sharing can be learnt from data. Next, we analyze the emergent connectivity and computation patterns in the trained DNAs. We find that the paths that tokens take through the models are themselves distributed according to a power-law. We show that some paths (or, equivalently, groups of modules) show emergent specialization.

To evaluate the ability of AI agents to reproduce results in an active research area, we introduce the Automated LLM Speedrunning Benchmark, leveraging the research community contributions on the NanoGPT speedrun, a competition to train a GPT-2 model in the shortest time. Each of the 19 speedrun tasks provides the agent with the previous records training script, optionally paired with one of three hint formats, ranging from pseudocode to paper-like descriptions of the new records improvements. Records execute quickly by design and speedrun improvements encompass diverse code-level changes, ranging from high-level algorithmic advancements to hardware-aware optimizations. These features make the benchmark both accessible and realistic for the frontier problem of improving LLM training. We find that recent reasoning LLMs combined with SoTA scaffolds struggle to reimplement already-known innovations in our benchmark, even when given detailed hints.

In reality, conclusions are rarely set in stone; additional context can strengthen or weaken an initial inference. To address this, we introduce Defeasible Video Entailment (DVidE), a new task that challenges models to think like doubters, constantly updating their reasoning based on evolving evidence. In DVidE, given a video premise and a textual hypothesis, models must determine whether a new update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis (classification version) or generate a coherent update that modifies the entailment relationship (generation version). For solving the classification task, we propose the Chain of Counterfactual Thought framework, utilizing counterfactual reasoning, ASR-enhanced video content, and rationale refinement to reduce inference bias. For the generation task, we develop a framework that combines ASR output with a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce coherent, contextually relevant updates aligned with the intended strengthener or weakener goals. Additionally, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset, with strengthener/weakener annotations and an LLM-based evaluation metric specifically designed for assessing generative performance. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements, highlighting our proposed method in enhancing dynamic reasoning capabilities of VLMMs.",

    "description": "arXiv:2505.19897v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have extended their impact beyond Natural Language Processing, substantially fostering the development of interdisciplinary research. Recently, various LLM-based agents have been developed to assist scientific discovery progress across multiple aspects and domains. Among these, computer-using agents, capable of interacting with operating systems as humans do, are paving the way to automated scientific problem-solving and addressing routines in researchers' workflows. Recognizing the transformative potential of these agents, we introduce ScienceBoard, which encompasses two complementary contributions: (i) a realistic, multi-domain environment featuring dynamic and visually rich scientific workflows with integrated professional software, where agents can autonomously interact via different interfaces to accelerate complex research tasks and experiments; and (ii) a challenging benchmark of 169 high-quality, rigorously validated real-world tasks curated by humans, spanning scientific-discovery workflows in domains such as biochemistry, astronomy, and geoinformatics. Extensive evaluations of agents with state-of-the-art backbones (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude 3.7, UI-TARS) show that, despite some promising results, they still fall short of reliably assisting scientists in complex workflows, achieving only a 15% overall success rate. In-depth analysis further provides valuable insights for addressing current agent limitations and more effective design principles, paving the way to build more capable agents for scientific discovery. Our code, environment, and benchmark are at https://qiushisun.github.io/ScienceBoard-Home/.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.22068v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: With the deep penetration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the transportation sector, intelligent cockpits, autonomous driving, and intelligent road networks are developing at an unprecedented pace. However, the data ecosystems of these three key areas are increasingly fragmented and incompatible. Especially, existing testing methods rely on data stacking, fail to cover all edge cases, and lack flexibility. To address this issue, this paper introduces the concept of 'Query as Test' (QaT). This concept shifts the focus from rigid, prescripted test cases to flexible, on-demand logical queries against a unified data representation. Specifically, we identify the need for a fundamental improvement in data storage and representation, leading to our proposal of 'Extensible Scenarios Notations' (ESN). ESN is a novel declarative data framework based on Answer Set Programming (ASP), which uniformly represents heterogeneous multimodal data from the cockpit, vehicle, and road as a collection of logical facts and rules. This approach not only achieves deep semantic fusion of data, but also brings three core advantages: (1) supports complex and flexible semantic querying through logical reasoning; (2) provides natural interpretability for decision-making processes; (3) allows for on-demand data abstraction through logical rules, enabling fine-grained privacy protection. We further elaborate on the QaT paradigm, transforming the functional validation and safety compliance checks of autonomous driving systems into logical queries against the ESN database, significantly enhancing the expressiveness and formal rigor of the testing. Finally, we introduce the concept of 'Validation-Driven Development' (VDD), which suggests to guide developments by logical validation rather than quantitative testing in the era of Large Language Models, in order to accelerating the iteration and development process.",

The proposed dynamics are based on the proximal augmented Lagrangian and they provide a viable alternative to ADMM which faces significant challenges from both analysis and implementation viewpoints in large-scale multi-block scenarios. In contrast to customized algorithms with individualized convergence guarantees, we develop a systematic approach for solving a broad class of challenging composite optimization problems. We leverage various structural properties to establish global (exponential) convergence guarantees for the proposed dynamics. Our assumptions are much weaker than those required to prove (exponential) stability of primal-dual dynamics as well as (linear) convergence of discrete-time methods such as standard two-block and multi-block ADMM and EXTRA algorithms. Finally, we show necessity of some of our structural assumptions for exponential stability and provide computational experiments to demonstrate the convenience of the proposed approach for parallel and distributed computing applications.",

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have changed the landscape of NLP by enabling more accessible and automated text analysis (e.g., topic detection, summarization, information extraction, etc.). We introduce VIDEE, a system that supports entry-level data analysts to conduct advanced text analytics with intelligent agents. VIDEE instantiates a human-agent collaroration workflow consisting of three stages: (1) Decomposition, which incorporates a human-in-the-loop Monte-Carlo Tree Search algorithm to support generative reasoning with human feedback, (2) Execution, which generates an executable text analytics pipeline, and (3) Evaluation, which integrates LLM-based evaluation and visualizations to support user validation of execution results. We conduct two quantitative experiments to evaluate VIDEE's effectiveness and analyze common agent errors. A user study involving participants with varying levels of NLP and text analytics experience -- from none to expert -- demonstrates the system's usability and reveals distinct user behavior patterns. The findings identify design implications for human-agent collaboration, validate the practical utility of VIDEE for non-expert users, and inform future improvements to intelligent text analytics systems.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.22358v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The increasing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into health and biomedical systems necessitates robust frameworks for transparency, accountability, and ethical compliance. Existing frameworks often rely on human-readable, manual documentation which limits scalability, comparability, and machine interpretability across projects and platforms. They also fail to provide a unique, verifiable identity for AI models to ensure their provenance and authenticity across systems and use cases, limiting reproducibility and stakeholder trust. This paper introduces the concept of the AI Model Passport, a structured and standardized documentation framework that acts as a digital identity and verification tool for AI models. It captures essential metadata to uniquely identify, verify, trace and monitor AI models across their lifecycle - from data acquisition and preprocessing to model design, development and deployment. In addition, an implementation of this framework is presented through AIPassport, an MLOps tool developed within the ProCAncer-I EU project for medical imaging applications. AIPassport automates metadata collection, ensures proper versioning, decouples results from source scripts, and integrates with various development environments. Its effectiveness is showcased through a lesion segmentation use case using data from the ProCAncer-I dataset, illustrating how the AI Model Passport enhances transparency, reproducibility, and regulatory readiness while reducing manual effort. This approach aims to set a new standard for fostering trust and accountability in AI-driven healthcare solutions, aspiring to serve as the basis for developing transparent and regulation compliant AI systems across domains.",

We show how Transformers can be viewed as message passing GNNs operating on fully connected graphs of tokens, where the self-attention mechanism capture the relative importance of all tokens w.r.t. each-other, and positional encodings provide hints about sequential ordering or structure. Thus, Transformers are expressive set processing networks that learn relationships among input elements without being constrained by apriori graphs. Despite this mathematical connection to GNNs, Transformers are implemented via dense matrix operations that are significantly more efficient on modern hardware than sparse message passing. This leads to the perspective that Transformers are GNNs currently winning the hardware lottery.",

Currently, massive fine-resolution remotely sensed (FRRS) images acquired by improving sensing and imaging technologies become available. However, accurate semantic segmentation of such FRRS images is greatly affected by substantial class disparities, the invisibility of key ground objects due to occlusion, and object size variation. Despite the extraordinary potential in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) in image feature learning and representation, extracting sufficient features from FRRS images for accurate semantic segmentation is still challenging. These challenges demand the deep learning models to learn robust features and generate sufficient feature descriptors. Specifically, learning multi-contextual features to guarantee adequate coverage of varied object sizes from the ground scene and harnessing global-local contexts to overcome class disparities challenge even profound networks. Deeper networks significantly lose spatial details due to gradual downsampling processes resulting in poor segmentation results and coarse boundaries. This article presents a stacked deep residual network (SDRNet) for semantic segmentation from FRRS images. The proposed framework utilizes two stacked encoder-decoder networks to harness long-range semantics yet preserve spatial information and dilated residual blocks (DRB) between each encoder and decoder network to capture sufficient global dependencies thus improving segmentation performance.

    "description": "arXiv:2506.21655v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are powerful at integrating diverse data, but they often struggle with complex reasoning. While Reinforcement learning (RL) can boost reasoning in LLMs, applying it to MLLMs is tricky. Common issues include a drop in performance on general tasks and the generation of overly detailed or 'overthinking' reasoning. Our work investigates how the KL penalty and overthinking affect RL training in MLLMs. We propose Asymmetric Policy Optimization (APO) to address these issues, which divides the sampled responses into positive and negative groups. For positive samples, Difficulty-Adaptive Divergence Shaping (DADS) is introduced to dynamically adjust the KL divergence weight based on their difficulty. This method prevents policy entropy from dropping sharply, improves training stability, utilizes samples better, and preserves the model's existing knowledge. For negative samples, Suboptimal Trajectory Complexity Regularization (STCR) is proposed to penalize overly long responses. This helps mitigate overthinking and encourages more concise reasoning while preserving the model's explorative capacity. We apply our method to Qwen2.5-VL-3B, creating View-R1-3B. View-R1-3B significantly enhances reasoning capabilities, showing an average 7% gain over the base model and outperforming larger MLLMs (7-11B) on various reasoning benchmarks. Importantly, unlike other reasoning-tuned MLLMs that often degrade on general tasks, View-R1-3B maintains consistent improvement, demonstrating superior generalization. These results highlight the effectiveness and broad applicability of our DADS and STCR techniques for advancing complex multimodal reasoning in MLLMs. The code will be made available at https://github.com/Indolent-Kawhi/View-R1.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.08134v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Peer review, the bedrock of scientific advancement in machine learning (ML), is strained by a crisis of scale. Exponential growth in manuscript submissions to premier ML venues such as NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR is outpacing the finite capacity of qualified reviewers, leading to concerns about review quality, consistency, and reviewer fatigue. This position paper argues that AI-assisted peer review must become an urgent research and infrastructure priority. We advocate for a comprehensive AI-augmented ecosystem, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) not as replacements for human judgment, but as sophisticated collaborators for authors, reviewers, and Area Chairs (ACs). We propose specific roles for AI in enhancing factual verification, guiding reviewer performance, assisting authors in quality improvement, and supporting ACs in decision-making. Crucially, we contend that the development of such systems hinges on access to more granular, structured, and ethically-sourced peer review process data. We outline a research agenda, including illustrative experiments, to develop and validate these AI assistants, and discuss significant technical and ethical challenges. We call upon the ML community to proactively build this AI-assisted future, ensuring the continued integrity and scalability of scientific validation, while maintaining high standards of peer review.",

    "title": "Dehazing Light Microscopy Images with Guided Conditional Flow Matching: finding a sweet spot between fidelity and realism",
    "description": "arXiv:2506.22397v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy is a major driver of scientific progress in the life sciences. Although high-end confocal microscopes are capable of filtering out-of-focus light, cheaper and more accessible microscopy modalities, such as widefield microscopy, can not, which consequently leads to hazy image data. Computational dehazing is trying to combine the best of both worlds, leading to cheap microscopy but crisp-looking images. The perception-distortion trade-off tells us that we can optimize either for data fidelity, e.g. low MSE or high PSNR, or for data realism, measured by perceptual metrics such as LPIPS or FID. Existing methods either prioritize fidelity at the expense of realism, or produce perceptually convincing results that lack quantitative accuracy. In this work, we propose HazeMatching, a novel iterative method for dehazing light microscopy images, which effectively balances these objectives. Our goal was to find a balanced trade-off between the fidelity of the dehazing results and the realism of individual predictions (samples). We achieve this by adapting the conditional flow matching framework by guiding the generative process with a hazy observation in the conditional velocity field. We evaluate HazeMatching on 5 datasets, covering both synthetic and real data, assessing both distortion and perceptual quality. Our method is compared against 7 baselines, achieving a consistent balance between fidelity and realism on average. Additionally, with calibration analysis, we show that HazeMatching produces well-calibrated predictions. Note that our method does not need an explicit degradation operator to exist, making it easily applicable on real microscopy data. All data used for training and evaluation and our code will be publicly available under a permissive license.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.21581v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Evaluation benchmark characteristics may distort the true benefits of domain adaptation in retrieval models. This creates misleading assessments that influence deployment decisions in specialized domains. We show that two benchmarks with drastically different features such as topic diversity, boundary overlap, and semantic complexity can influence the perceived benefits of fine-tuning. Using environmental regulatory document retrieval as a case study, we fine-tune ColBERTv2 model on Environmental Impact Statements (EIS) from federal agencies. We evaluate these models across two benchmarks with different semantic structures. Our findings reveal that identical domain adaptation approaches show very different perceived benefits depending on evaluation methodology. On one benchmark, with clearly separated topic boundaries, domain adaptation shows small improvements (maximum 0.61% NDCG gain). However, on the other benchmark with overlapping semantic structures, the same models demonstrate large improvements (up to 2.22% NDCG gain), a 3.6-fold difference in the performance benefit. We compare these benchmarks through topic diversity metrics, finding that the higher-performing benchmark shows 11% higher average cosine distances between contexts and 23% lower silhouette scores, directly contributing to the observed performance difference. These results demonstrate that benchmark selection strongly determines assessments of retrieval system effectiveness in specialized domains. Evaluation frameworks with well-separated topics regularly underestimate domain adaptation benefits, while those with overlapping semantic boundaries reveal improvements that better reflect real-world regulatory document complexity. Our findings have important implications for developing and deploying AI systems for interdisciplinary domains that integrate multiple topics.",

Intrinsic motivation attempts to decouple exploration from external, task-based rewards. However, established approaches to intrinsic motivation that follow general principles such as information gain, often only uncover low-level interactions. In contrast, children's play suggests that they engage in meaningful high-level behavior by imitating or interacting with their caregivers. Recent work has focused on using foundation models to inject these semantic biases into exploration. However, these methods often rely on unrealistic assumptions, such as language-embedded environments or access to high-level actions. We propose SEmaNtically Sensible ExploratIon (SENSEI), a framework to equip model-based RL agents with an intrinsic motivation for semantically meaningful behavior. SENSEI distills a reward signal of interestingness from Vision Language Model (VLM) annotations, enabling an agent to predict these rewards through a world model. Using model-based RL, SENSEI trains an exploration policy that jointly maximizes semantic rewards and uncertainty. We show that in both robotic and video game-like simulations SENSEI discovers a variety of meaningful behaviors from image observations and low-level actions. SENSEI provides a general tool for learning from foundation model feedback, a crucial research direction, as VLMs become more powerful.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.21990v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The developments in transformer encoder-decoder architectures have led to significant breakthroughs in machine translation, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), and instruction-based chat machines, among other applications. The pre-trained models were trained on vast amounts of generic data over a few epochs (fewer than five in most cases), resulting in their strong generalization capabilities. Nevertheless, the performance of these models does suffer when applied to niche domains like transcribing pilot speech in the cockpit, which involves a lot of specific vocabulary and multilingual conversations. This paper investigates and improves the transcription accuracy of cockpit conversations with Whisper models. We have collected around 85 minutes of cockpit simulator recordings and 130 minutes of interview recordings with pilots and manually labeled them. The speakers are middle aged men speaking both German and English. To improve the accuracy of transcriptions, we propose multiple normalization schemes to refine the transcripts and improve Word Error Rate (WER). We then employ fine-tuning to enhance ASR performance, utilizing performance-efficient fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Hereby, WER decreased from 68.49 % (pretrained whisper Large model without normalization baseline) to 26.26% (finetuned whisper Large model with the proposed normalization scheme).",

    "description": "arXiv:2501.10814v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: 3D models surpass 2D models in CT/MRI segmentation by effectively capturing inter-slice relationships. However, the added depth dimension substantially increases memory consumption. While patch-based training alleviates memory constraints, it significantly slows down the inference speed due to the sliding window (SW) approach. We propose No-More-Sliding-Window (NMSW), a novel end-to-end trainable framework that enhances the efficiency of generic 3D segmentation backbone during an inference step by eliminating the need for SW. NMSW employs a differentiable Top-k module to selectively sample only the most relevant patches, thereby minimizing redundant computations. When patch-level predictions are insufficient, the framework intelligently leverages coarse global predictions to refine results. Evaluated across 3 tasks using 3 segmentation backbones, NMSW achieves competitive accuracy compared to SW inference while significantly reducing computational complexity by 91% (88.0 to 8.00 TMACs). Moreover, it delivers a 9.1x faster inference on the H100 GPU (99.0 to 8.3 sec) and a 11.1x faster inference on the Xeon Gold CPU (2110 to 189 sec). NMSW is model-agnostic, further boosting efficiency when integrated with any existing efficient segmentation backbones. The code is avaialble: https://github.com/Youngseok0001/open_nmsw.",

    "description": "arXiv:2401.11212v4 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Recent trends like the Internet of Things (IoT) suggest a vision of dense and multi-scale deployments of computing devices in nearly all kinds of environments. A prominent engineering challenge revolves around programming the collective adaptive behaviour of such computational ecosystems. This requires abstractions able to capture concepts like ensembles (dynamic groups of cooperating devices) and collective tasks (joint activities carried out by ensembles). In this work, we consider collections of devices interacting with neighbours and that execute in nearly-synchronised sense-compute-interact rounds, where the computation is given by a single program mapping sensing values and incoming messages to output and outcoming messages. To support programming whole computational collectives, we propose the abstraction of a distributed collective process, which can be used to define at once the ensemble formation logic and its collective task. We formalise the abstraction in the eXchange Calculus (XC), a core functional language based on neighbouring values (maps from neighbours to values) where state and interaction is handled through a single primitive, exchange, and provide a corresponding implementation in the FCPP language. Then, we exercise distributed collective processes using two case studies: multi-hop message propagation and distributed monitoring of spatial properties. Finally, we discuss the features of the abstraction and its suitability for different kinds of distributed computing applications.",

    "description": "arXiv:2502.20758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: We introduce a new approach in which several advanced large language models-specifically GPT-4-0125-preview, Meta-LLAMA-3-70B-Instruct, Claude-3-Opus, and Gemini-1.5-Flash-collaborate to both produce and answer intricate, doctoral-level probability problems without relying on any single 'correct' reference. Rather than depending on an established ground truth, our investigation focuses on how agreement among diverse models can signal the reliability of their outputs and, by extension, reflect the overall quality of the generated questions. To measure this inter-model alignment, we apply a suite of statistical evaluations, including chi-square tests, Fleiss' Kappa coefficients, and confidence interval calculations, thereby capturing both precision in answers and clarity in question phrasing. Our analysis reveals that Claude and Gemini tend to frame questions more coherently and unambiguously, which is evidenced by their tighter confidence intervals and greater concordance with responding agents. In contrast, LLAMA exhibits wider confidence bands and a lower level of agreement, indicating more variability and reduced consistency in its question formulations. These observations support the notion that a multi-model collaborative strategy not only improves answer dependability but also offers an effective, data-driven mechanism for evaluating and refining question quality when no definitive solution exists. Ultimately, this work delivers actionable insights into enhancing AI-guided reasoning processes through coordinated interactions among heterogeneous language models.",

This study evaluates defense mechanisms for the YOLOv5 model against such attacks. Optimized adversarial patches were generated and placed in sensitive image regions, by applying EigenCAM and grid search to determine optimal placement. We tested several defenses, including Segment and Complete (SAC), Inpainting, and Latent Diffusion Models. Our pipeline comprises three main stages: patch application, object detection, and defense analysis. Results indicate that adversarial patches reduce average detection confidence by 22.06%. Defenses restored confidence levels by 3.45% (SAC), 5.05% (Inpainting), and significantly improved them by 26.61%, which even exceeds the original accuracy levels, when using the Latent Diffusion Model, highlighting its superior effectiveness in mitigating the effects of adversarial patches.",

Defenses restored confidence levels by 3.45% (SAC), 5.05% (Inpainting), and significantly improved them by 26.61%, which even exceeds the original accuracy levels, when using the Latent Diffusion Model, highlighting its superior effectiveness in mitigating the effects of adversarial patches.",

Some of these datasets are often sensitive, and need adequate privacy protections. There are many models of privacy, but Differential Privacy (DP) has become a de facto standard because of its strong guarantees, without making models about adversaries. In this paper, we develop a framework the integrates deep learning and epidemic models to simultaneously perform epidemic forecasting and learning a mechanistic model of epidemic spread, while incorporating multiple datasets for these analyses, including some with DP guarantees. We demonstrate our framework using a realistic but synthetic financial dataset with DP; such a dataset has not been used in such epidemic analyses.

In contrast to widely used English-language benchmarks that often rely on artificially difficult or decontextualized problems, this dataset draws from real middle school curricula across nine domains including mathematics, history, biology, and religion. The benchmark includes over 2,000 open-ended questions grounded in 486 images, ensuring that models must integrate visual interpretation with factual reasoning rather than rely on superficial textual cues. We evaluate thirteen state-of-the-art open-weight VLMs across multiple dimensions, including domain-specific accuracy and performance on adversarial crafted questions. Our findings reveal that even the strongest models achieve less than 45% overall accuracy, with particularly poor performance in music, mathematics, and adversarial settings. Furthermore, the results indicate significant discrepancies between success on popular benchmarks and real-world multimodal understanding. We conclude that middle school-level tasks offer a meaningful and underutilized avenue for stress-testing VLMs, especially in non-English contexts. The dataset and evaluation protocol serve as a rigorous testbed to better understand and improve the visual and linguistic reasoning capabilities of future AI systems.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.21669v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Self-evolution, the ability of agents to autonomously improve their reasoning and behavior, is essential for the embodied domain with long-horizon, real-world tasks. Despite current advancements in reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) showing strong performance in enhancing reasoning in LLMs, its potential to enable self-evolving embodied intelligence with multi-modal interactions remains largely unexplored. Specifically, reinforcement fine-tuning faces two fundamental obstacles in embodied settings: (i) the lack of accessible intermediate rewards in multi-step reasoning tasks limits effective learning signals, and (ii) reliance on hand-crafted reward functions restricts generalization to novel tasks and environments. To address these challenges, we present Self-Evolving Embodied Agents-R1, SEEA-R1, the first RFT framework designed for enabling the self-evolving capabilities of embodied agents. Specifically, to convert sparse delayed rewards into denser intermediate signals that improve multi-step reasoning, we propose Tree-based group relative policy optimization (Tree-GRPO), which integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search into GRPO. To generalize reward estimation across tasks and scenes, supporting autonomous adaptation and reward-driven self-evolution, we further introduce Multi-modal Generative Reward Model (MGRM). To holistically evaluate the effectiveness of SEEA-R1, we evaluate on the ALFWorld benchmark, surpassing state-of-the-art methods with scores of 85.07% (textual) and 36.19% (multi-modal), outperforming prior models including GPT-4o. SEEA-R1 also achieves scores of 80.3% without environmental reward, surpassing all open-source baselines and highlighting its scalability as a self-evolving embodied agent. Additional experiments and qualitative analysis further support the potential of SEEA-R1 for future research in scalable embodied intelligence.",

However, as the conversation rounds continue, it is required to store a large amount of KV cache in GPU memory, which significantly affects the efficiency and even availability of the model serving systems. This paper analyzes dialogue data from real users on the granularity of round and discovers that the LLM inference manifests a watershed layer, after which the distribution of round-level attention shows notable similarity. Based on this, we propose Round Attention - a novel round-level attention mechanism that selectively processes the KV cache of top-k relevant rounds, where k is dynamically determined through the attention matrix in the watershed layer. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that our method reduces memory usage by 54% to 82%, while experimental results confirm that loading sparse critical-round KV cache maintains answer accuracy without performance degradation.",

    "description": "arXiv:2505.02862v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which can compromise their safety mechanisms. Existing studies often rely on brute-force optimization or manual design, failing to uncover potential risks in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose a novel jailbreak attack framework, ICRT, inspired by heuristics and biases in human cognition. Leveraging the simplicity effect, we employ cognitive decomposition to reduce the complexity of malicious prompts. Simultaneously, relevance bias is utilized to reorganize prompts, enhancing semantic alignment and inducing harmful outputs effectively. Furthermore, we introduce a ranking-based harmfulness evaluation metric that surpasses the traditional binary success-or-failure paradigm by employing ranking aggregation methods such as Elo, HodgeRank, and Rank Centrality to comprehensively quantify the harmfulness of generated content. Experimental results show that our approach consistently bypasses mainstream LLMs' safety mechanisms and generates high-risk content, providing insights into jailbreak attack risks and contributing to stronger defense strategies.",

Consequently, there is rising interest in model size reduction methods. To address this issue, we propose Projected Compression, a novel model compression technique, that reduces model weights by utilizing projection modules. Specifically, we first train additional trainable projections weights and preserve access to all the original model parameters. Subsequently, these projections are merged into a lower-dimensional product matrix, resulting in a reduced-size standard Transformer-based model. Unlike alternative approaches that require additional computational overhead, our method matches the base model's per-token computation step in FLOPs. Experimental results show that Projected Compression outperforms the comparable hard pruning and retraining approach on higher quality models.

We compare supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using preference-labeled data, and Reinforce Leave-One-Out (RLOO) with reward models. Our experiments show that RLOO with DeBERTa reward modeling achieves the best alignment, while DPO provides strong and consistent results. For math reasoing tasks, synthetic data augmentation and best-of-N sampling with an external verifier significantly improve accuracy, showing the potential of combining fine-tuning with inference-time tools.

Design considerations from prior work can serve as a valuable and efficient foundation for future systems. To support this effort, we conducted a systematic literature review of 62 papers on co-creative systems. These papers cover a diverse range of applications, including visual arts, design, and writing, where the AI acts not just as a tool but as an active collaborator in the creative process. From this review, we identified several key dimensions relevant to system design: phase of the creative process, creative task, proactive behavior of the system, user control, system embodiment, and AI model type. Our findings suggest that systems offering high user control lead to greater satisfaction, trust, and a stronger sense of ownership over creative outcomes. Furthermore, proactive systems, when adaptive and context sensitive, can enhance collaboration. We also extracted 24 design considerations, highlighting the value of encouraging users to externalize their thoughts and of increasing the system's social presence and transparency to foster trust. Despite recent advancements, important gaps remain, such as limited support for early creative phases like problem clarification, and challenges related to user adaptation to AI systems.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.22321v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Hearables are wearable computers that are worn on the ear. Bone conduction microphones (BCMs) are used with air conduction microphones (ACMs) in hearables as a supporting modality for multimodal speech enhancement (SE) in noisy conditions. However, existing works don't consider the following practical aspects for low-power implementations on hearables: (i) They do not explore how lowering the sampling frequencies and bit resolutions in analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) of hearables jointly impact low-power processing and multimodal SE in terms of speech quality and intelligibility. (ii) They don't discuss how GAN-like audio quality can be achieved without using actual GAN discriminators. And (iii) They don't process signals from ACMs/BCMs at sub-Nyquist sampling rate because, in their frameworks, they lack a wideband reconstruction methodology from their narrowband parts. We propose SUBARU (textbf{Sub}-Nyquist textbf{A}udio textbf{R}esolution textbf{U}psampling), which achieves the following: SUBARU (i) intentionally uses sub-Nyquist sampling and low bit resolution in ADCs, achieving a 3.31x reduction in power consumption; (ii) introduces novel multi-scale and multi-period virtual discriminators, which achieve GAN-like audio quality without using GANs' adversarial training; and (iii) achieves streaming operations on mobile platforms and SE in in-the-wild noisy conditions with an inference time of 1.74ms and a memory footprint of less than 13.77MB.",

While previous research has primarily focused on locating evidence pages through precise multimodal queries, our work investigates a fundamental yet overlooked aspect: how input format influences document comprehension performance. Through systematic analysis, we discover that raw OCR text often impairs rather than improves MLLMs' performance, which is a counterintuitive finding we attribute to attention dispersion and structure loss. To further substantiate our hypothesis, we propose a novel structure-preserving approach that encodes document elements using the LaTex paradigm, maintaining the hierarchical organization and spatial relationships critical for comprehension. Our attention analysis reveals that structured text induces structured attention patterns on both textual and visual content, directing models to focus on semantically meaningful regions while reducing attention waste. This approach significantly enhances MLLMs' document question answering performance across diverse document types without requiring architectural modifications or additional training.",

A major bottleneck is software: current robot stacks demand steep learning curves, low-level C/C++ expertise, fragmented tooling, and intricate hardware integration, in stark contrast to the Python-centric, well-documented ecosystems that propelled modern AI. We introduce ARK, an open-source, Python-first robotics framework designed to close that gap. ARK presents a Gym-style environment interface that allows users to collect data, preprocess it, and train policies using state-of-the-art imitation-learning algorithms (e.g., ACT, Diffusion Policy) while seamlessly toggling between high-fidelity simulation and physical robots. A lightweight client-server architecture provides networked publisher-subscriber communication, and optional C/C++ bindings ensure real-time performance when needed. ARK ships with reusable modules for control, SLAM, motion planning, system identification, and visualization, along with native ROS interoperability. Comprehensive documentation and case studies-from manipulation to mobile navigation-demonstrate rapid prototyping, effortless hardware swapping, and end-to-end pipelines that rival the convenience of mainstream machine-learning workflows. By unifying robotics and AI practices under a common Python umbrella, ARK lowers entry barriers and accelerates research and commercial deployment of autonomous robots.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.21817v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Scientific English has undergone rapid and unprecedented changes in recent years, with words such as 'delve,' 'intricate,' and 'crucial' showing significant spikes in frequency since around 2022. These changes are widely attributed to the growing influence of Large Language Models like ChatGPT in the discourse surrounding bias and misalignment. However, apart from changes in frequency, the exact structure of these linguistic shifts has remained unclear. The present study addresses this and investigates whether these changes involve the replacement of synonyms by suddenly 'spiking words,' for example, 'crucial' replacing 'essential' and 'key,' or whether they reflect broader semantic and pragmatic qualifications. To further investigate structural changes, we include part of speech tagging in our analysis to quantify linguistic shifts over grammatical categories and differentiate between word forms, like 'potential' as a noun vs. as an adjective. We systematically analyze synonym groups for widely discussed 'spiking words' based on frequency trends in scientific abstracts from PubMed. We find that entire semantic clusters often shift together, with most or all words in a group increasing in usage. This pattern suggests that changes induced by Large Language Models are primarily semantic and pragmatic rather than purely lexical. Notably, the adjective 'important' shows a significant decline, which prompted us to systematically analyze decreasing lexical items. Our analysis of 'collapsing' words reveals a more complex picture, which is consistent with organic language change and contrasts with the patterns of the abrupt spikes. These insights into the structure of language change contribute to our understanding of how language technology continues to shape human language.",

    "description": "arXiv:2412.04783v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Wireless sensing has recently found widespread applications in diverse environments, including homes, offices, and public spaces. By analyzing patterns in channel state information (CSI), it is possible to infer human actions for tasks such as person identification, gesture recognition, and fall detection. However, CSI is highly sensitive to environmental changes, where even minor alterations can significantly distort the CSI patterns. This sensitivity often leads to performance degradation or outright failure when applying wireless sensing models trained in one environment to another. To address this challenge, Domain Alignment (DAL) has been widely adopted for cross-domain classification tasks, as it focuses on aligning the global distributions of the source and target domains in feature space. Despite its popularity, DAL often neglects inter-category relationships, which can lead to misalignment between categories across domains, even when global alignment is achieved. To overcome these limitations, we propose K-Nearest Neighbors Maximum Mean Discrepancy (KNN-MMD), a novel few-shot method for cross-domain wireless sensing. Our approach begins by constructing a help set using KNN from the target domain, enabling local alignment between the source and target domains within each category using MMD. Additionally, we address a key instability issue commonly observed in cross-domain methods, where model performance fluctuates sharply between epochs. Further, most existing methods struggle to determine an optimal stopping point during training due to the absence of labeled data from the target domain. Our method resolves this by excluding the support set from the target domain during training and employing it as a validation set to determine the stopping criterion.The dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/RS2002/KNN-MMD .",

    "description": "arXiv:2410.16589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Sentiment analysis has become increasingly important for assessing public opinion and informing decision-making. Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized this field by capturing nuanced language patterns. However, adapting LLMs to domain-specific sentiment analysis tasks remains challenging due to computational constraints and the need for optimal fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Dynamic Adaptive Rank Space Exploration (DARSE) framework for efficient and effective sentiment analysis using LLMs. DARSE consists of a coarse-grained greedy algorithm to identify the optimal rank range, a fine-grained exploration algorithm to refine rank selection, and a dynamic rank allocation method to determine the optimal rank combination for each LLM layer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DARSE significantly improves sentiment analysis accuracy, achieving a 15.1% improvement in MSE and a 4.3% improvement in accuracy compared to previous work. Our framework strikes a balance between computational efficiency and model performance, making it a promising approach for sentiment analysis with LLMs.",

Despite significant advances in mobility research, there remains a critical gap in simulation platforms that allow for algorithm development, policy implementation, and comprehensive evaluation at scale. Traditional activity-based models require extensive data collection and manual calibration, machine learning approaches struggle with adaptation to dynamic conditions, and treding agent-based Large Language Models (LLMs) implementations face computational constraints with large-scale simulations. To address these challenges, we propose MobiVerse, a hybrid framework leverages the efficiency of lightweight domain-specific generator for generating base activity chains with the adaptability of LLMs for context-aware modifications. A case study was conducted in Westwood, Los Angeles, where we efficiently generated and dynamically adjusted schedules for the whole population of approximately 53,000 agents on a standard PC. Our experiments demonstrate that MobiVerse successfully enables agents to respond to environmental feedback, including road closures, large gathering events like football games, and congestion, through our hybrid framework. Its modular design facilitates testing various mobility algorithms at both transportation system and agent levels. Results show our approach maintains computational efficiency while enhancing behavioral realism.

To facilitate research addressing these challenges, we introduce PARSEC, an object rearrangement benchmark for learning user organizational preferences from observed scene context to place objects in a partially arranged environment. PARSEC is built upon a novel dataset of 110K rearrangement examples crowdsourced from 72 users, featuring 93 object categories and 15 environments. To better align with real-world organizational habits, we propose ContextSortLM, an LLM-based personalized rearrangement model that handles flexible user preferences by explicitly accounting for objects with multiple valid placement locations when placing items in partially arranged environments. We evaluate ContextSortLM and existing personalized rearrangement approaches on the PARSEC benchmark and complement these findings with a crowdsourced evaluation of 108 online raters ranking model predictions based on alignment with user preferences. Our results indicate that personalized rearrangement models leveraging multiple scene context sources perform better than models relying on a single context source. Moreover, ContextSortLM outperforms other models in placing objects to replicate the target user's arrangement and ranks among the top two in all three environment categories, as rated by online evaluators. Importantly, our evaluation highlights challenges associated with modeling environment semantics across different environment categories and provides recommendations for future work.",

The maxpool function is decomposed as a series of ReLU functions to extend the convex relaxation technique to maxpool functions, by which the verified bound can be efficiently computed through a dual network. The experimental results demonstrate that this technique allows the state-of-the-art verification precision for maxpool-based CNNs and involves a much lower computational cost than current verification methods, such as DeepZ, DeepPoly and PRIMA. This method is also applicable to large-scale CNNs, which previous studies show to be often computationally prohibitively expensive. Under certain circumstances, CAPM is 40-times, 20-times or twice as fast and give a significantly higher verification bound (CAPM 98% vs. PRIMA 76%/DeepPoly 73%/DeepZ 8%) as compared to PRIMA/DeepPoly/DeepZ. Furthermore, we additionally present the time complexity of our algorithm as $O(W^2NK)$, where $W$ is the maximum width of the neural network, $N$ is the number of neurons, and $K$ is the size of the maxpool layer's kernel.",

However, one of the well-known drawbacks of decision trees, as compared to decision graphs, is that decision trees cannot reuse the decision nodes. Nevertheless, decision graphs were not commonly used in deep learning due to the lack of efficient gradient-based training techniques. In this paper, we fill this gap and provide a general paradigm based on Markov processes, which allows for efficient training of the special type of decision graphs, which we call Self-Organizing Neural Graphs (SONG).

Current methods often rely on selective testing and undocumented assumptions about risk priorities, frequently failing to make a serious attempt at assessing the set of pathways through which AI systems pose direct or indirect risks to society and the biosphere. This paper introduces the probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) for AI framework, adapting established PRA techniques from high-reliability industries (e.g., nuclear power, aerospace) for the new challenges of advanced AI. The framework guides assessors in identifying potential risks, estimating likelihood and severity bands, and explicitly documenting evidence, underlying assumptions, and analyses at appropriate granularities. The framework's implementation tool synthesizes the results into a risk report card with aggregated risk estimates from all assessed risks. It introduces three methodological advances: (1) Aspect-oriented hazard analysis provides systematic hazard coverage guided by a first-principles taxonomy of AI system aspects (e.g. capabilities, domain knowledge, affordances); (2) Risk pathway modeling analyzes causal chains from system aspects to societal impacts using bidirectional analysis and incorporating prospective techniques; and (3) Uncertainty management employs scenario decomposition, reference scales, and explicit tracing protocols to structure credible projections with novelty or limited data. Additionally, the framework harmonizes diverse assessment methods by integrating evidence into comparable, quantified absolute risk estimates for lifecycle decisions.

But CoT can also systematically misrepresent the factors influencing models' behavior -- for example, rationalizing answers in line with a user's opinion. We first create a new dataset of 9 different biases that affect GPT-3.5-Turbo and Llama-8b models. These consist of spurious-few-shot patterns, post hoc rationalization, and sycophantic settings. Models switch to the answer implied by the bias, without mentioning the effect of the bias in the CoT. To mitigate this biased reasoning problem, we introduce bias-augmented consistency training (BCT), an unsupervised fine-tuning scheme that trains models to give consistent reasoning across prompts with and without biasing features. We construct a suite testing nine forms of biased reasoning on seven question-answering tasks, and find that applying BCT to GPT-3.5-Turbo with one bias reduces the rate of biased reasoning by 86% on held-out tasks. Moreover, this model generalizes to other forms of bias, reducing biased reasoning on held-out biases by an average of 37%. As BCT generalizes to held-out biases and does not require gold labels, this method may hold promise for reducing biased reasoning from as-of-yet unknown biases and on tasks where ground truth reasoning is unavailable.",

Two new conditional probability distributions are developed for the new binned semiparametric Bayesian networks, the sparse binned kernel density estimation and the Fourier kernel density estimation. These two probability distributions address the curse of dimensionality, which typically impacts binned models, by using sparse tensors and restricting the number of parent nodes in conditional probability calculations. To evaluate the proposal, we perform a complexity analysis and conduct several comparative experiments using synthetic data and datasets from the UCI Machine Learning repository. The experiments include different binning rules, parent restrictions, grid sizes, and number of instances to get a holistic view of the model's behavior. As a result, our binned semiparametric Bayesian networks achieve structural learning and log-likelihood estimations with no statistically significant differences compared to the semiparametric Bayesian networks, but at a much higher speed. Thus, the new binned semiparametric Bayesian networks prove to be a reliable and more efficient alternative to their non-binned counterparts.",

Despite recent advances, ASR models like Whisper struggle with non-normative speech due to limited training data and the difficulty of collecting and annotating non-normative speech samples. In this work, we propose a practical and lightweight pipeline to personalize ASR models, formalizing the selection of words and enriching a small, speech-impaired dataset with semantic coherence. Applied to data from a child with a structural speech impairment, our approach shows promising improvements in transcription quality, demonstrating the potential to reduce communication barriers for individuals with atypical speech patterns.",

Aim: We aim to systematically synthesize the use, rationale, contexts, usability, and future challenges of GenAI in software architecture. Method: We performed a multivocal literature review (MLR), analyzing peer-reviewed and gray literature, identifying current practices, models, adoption contexts, and reported challenges, extracting themes via open coding. Results: Our review identified significant adoption of GenAI for architectural decision support and architectural reconstruction. OpenAI GPT models are predominantly applied, and there is consistent use of techniques such as few-shot prompting and retrieved-augmented generation (RAG). GenAI has been applied mostly to initial stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), such as Requirements-to-Architecture and Architecture-to-Code. Monolithic and microservice architectures were the dominant targets. However, rigorous testing of GenAI outputs was typically missing from the studies. Among the most frequent challenges are model precision, hallucinations, ethical aspects, privacy issues, lack of architecture-specific datasets, and the absence of sound evaluation frameworks. Conclusions: GenAI shows significant potential in software design, but several challenges remain on its path to greater adoption. Research efforts should target designing general evaluation methodologies, handling ethics and precision, increasing transparency and explainability, and promoting architecture-specific datasets and benchmarks to bridge the gap between theoretical possibilities and practical use.",

Legal case documents offer valuable insights but are unstructured, lexically dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references-posing challenges for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. Existing KG methods often rely on static templates and lack coreference resolution, while recent LLM-based approaches frequently produce noisy, fragmented graphs due to hallucinations, and duplicate nodes caused by a lack of guided extraction. We propose CORE-KG, a modular framework for building interpretable KGs from legal texts. It uses a two-step pipeline: (1) type-aware coreference resolution via sequential, structured LLM prompts, and (2) entity and relationship extraction using domain-guided instructions, built on an adapted GraphRAG framework. CORE-KG reduces node duplication by 33.28%, and legal noise by 38.37% compared to a GraphRAG-based baseline-resulting in cleaner and more coherent graph structures. These improvements make CORE-KG a strong foundation for analyzing complex criminal networks.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.21976v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The goal of traffic simulation is to augment a potentially limited amount of manually-driven miles that is available for testing and validation, with a much larger amount of simulated synthetic miles. The culmination of this vision would be a generative simulated city, where given a map of the city and an autonomous vehicle (AV) software stack, the simulator can seamlessly simulate the trip from point A to point B by populating the city around the AV and controlling all aspects of the scene, from animating the dynamic agents (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians) to controlling the traffic light states. We refer to this vision as CitySim, which requires an agglomeration of simulation technologies: scene generation to populate the initial scene, agent behavior modeling to animate the scene, occlusion reasoning, dynamic scene generation to seamlessly spawn and remove agents, and environment simulation for factors such as traffic lights. While some key technologies have been separately studied in various works, others such as dynamic scene generation and environment simulation have received less attention in the research community. We propose SceneDiffuser++, the first end-to-end generative world model trained on a single loss function capable of point A-to-B simulation on a city scale integrating all the requirements above. We demonstrate the city-scale traffic simulation capability of SceneDiffuser++ and study its superior realism under long simulation conditions. We evaluate the simulation quality on an augmented version of the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) with larger map regions to support trip-level simulation.",

We propose text-to-text regression as a general, scalable alternative. For predicting resource efficiency on Borg, Google's massive compute cluster scheduling system, a 60M parameter encoder-decoder, trained from random initialization, achieves up to a near perfect 0.99 (0.9 average) rank correlation across the entire fleet, and 100x lower MSE than tabular approaches.

    "description": "arXiv:2506.21611v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest in incorporating textual information into foundation models for time series forecasting. However, it remains unclear whether and under what conditions such multimodal integration consistently yields gains. We systematically investigate these questions across a diverse benchmark of 14 forecasting tasks spanning 7 domains, including health, environment, and economics. We evaluate two popular multimodal forecasting paradigms: aligning-based methods, which align time series and text representations; and prompting-based methods, which directly prompt large language models for forecasting. Although prior works report gains from multimodal input, we find these effects are not universal across datasets and models, and multimodal methods sometimes do not outperform the strongest unimodal baselines. To understand when textual information helps, we disentangle the effects of model architectural properties and data characteristics. Our findings highlight that on the modeling side, incorporating text information is most helpful given (1) high-capacity text models, (2) comparatively weaker time series models, and (3) appropriate aligning strategies. On the data side, performance gains are more likely when (4) sufficient training data is available and (5) the text offers complementary predictive signal beyond what is already captured from the time series alone. Our empirical findings offer practical guidelines for when multimodality can be expected to aid forecasting tasks, and when it does not.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.18071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Grounded Video Question Answering (Grounded VideoQA) requires aligning textual answers with explicit visual evidence. However, modern multimodal models often rely on linguistic priors and spurious correlations, resulting in poorly grounded predictions. In this work, we propose MUPA, a cooperative MUlti-Path Agentic approach that unifies video grounding, question answering, answer reflection and aggregation to tackle Grounded VideoQA. MUPA features three distinct reasoning paths on the interplay of grounding and QA agents in different chronological orders, along with a dedicated reflection agent to judge and aggregate the multi-path results to accomplish consistent QA and grounding. This design markedly improves grounding fidelity without sacrificing answer accuracy. Despite using only 2B parameters, our method outperforms all 7B-scale competitors. When scaled to 7B parameters, MUPA establishes new state-of-the-art results, with Acc@GQA of 30.3% and 47.4% on NExT-GQA and DeVE-QA respectively, demonstrating MUPA' effectiveness towards trustworthy video-language understanding.

    "title": "PEACE: Empowering Geologic Map Holistic Understanding with MLLMs",
    "description": "arXiv:2501.06184v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Geologic map, as a fundamental diagram in geology science, provides critical insights into the structure and composition of Earth's subsurface and surface. These maps are indispensable in various fields, including disaster detection, resource exploration, and civil engineering. Despite their significance, current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often fall short in geologic map understanding. This gap is primarily due to the challenging nature of cartographic generalization, which involves handling high-resolution map, managing multiple associated components, and requiring domain-specific knowledge. To quantify this gap, we construct GeoMap-Bench, the first-ever benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in geologic map understanding, which assesses the full-scale abilities in extracting, referring, grounding, reasoning, and analyzing. To bridge this gap, we introduce GeoMap-Agent, the inaugural agent designed for geologic map understanding, which features three modules: Hierarchical Information Extraction (HIE), Domain Knowledge Injection (DKI), and Prompt-enhanced Question Answering (PEQA). Inspired by the interdisciplinary collaboration among human scientists, an AI expert group acts as consultants, utilizing a diverse tool pool to comprehensively analyze questions. Through comprehensive experiments, GeoMap-Agent achieves an overall score of 0.811 on GeoMap-Bench, significantly outperforming 0.369 of GPT-4o.

    "description": "arXiv:2506.21734v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Reasoning, the process of devising and executing complex goal-oriented action sequences, remains a critical challenge in AI. Current large language models (LLMs) primarily employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques, which suffer from brittle task decomposition, extensive data requirements, and high latency. Inspired by the hierarchical and multi-timescale processing in the human brain, we propose the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM), a novel recurrent architecture that attains significant computational depth while maintaining both training stability and efficiency. HRM executes sequential reasoning tasks in a single forward pass without explicit supervision of the intermediate process, through two interdependent recurrent modules: a high-level module responsible for slow, abstract planning, and a low-level module handling rapid, detailed computations. With only 27 million parameters, HRM achieves exceptional performance on complex reasoning tasks using only 1000 training samples. The model operates without pre-training or CoT data, yet achieves nearly perfect performance on challenging tasks including complex Sudoku puzzles and optimal path finding in large mazes. Furthermore, HRM outperforms much larger models with significantly longer context windows on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a key benchmark for measuring artificial general intelligence capabilities. These results underscore HRM's potential as a transformative advancement toward universal computation and general-purpose reasoning systems.",

However, the open-source nature of these benchmarks and the broad sources of training data for LLMs have inevitably led to benchmark contamination, resulting in unreliable evaluation results. To alleviate this issue, we propose a contamination-free and more challenging MCQ benchmark called MMLU-CF. This benchmark reassesses LLMs' understanding of world knowledge by averting both unintentional and malicious data leakage. To avoid unintentional data leakage, we source data from a broader domain and design three decontamination rules. To prevent malicious data leakage, we divide the benchmark into validation and test sets with similar difficulty and subject distributions. The test set remains closed-source to ensure reliable results, while the validation set is publicly available to promote transparency and facilitate independent verification. Our evaluation of mainstream LLMs reveals that the powerful GPT-4o achieves merely a 5-shot score of 73.4% and a 0-shot score of 71.9% on the test set, which indicates the effectiveness of our approach in creating a more rigorous and contamination-free evaluation standard.

However, the open-source nature of these benchmarks and the broad sources of training data for LLMs have inevitably led to benchmark contamination, resulting in unreliable evaluation results. To alleviate this issue, we propose a contamination-free and more challenging MCQ benchmark called MMLU-CF. This benchmark reassesses LLMs' understanding of world knowledge by averting both unintentional and malicious data leakage. To avoid unintentional data leakage, we source data from a broader domain and design three decontamination rules. To prevent malicious data leakage, we divide the benchmark into validation and test sets with similar difficulty and subject distributions. The test set remains closed-source to ensure reliable results, while the validation set is publicly available to promote transparency and facilitate independent verification. Our evaluation of mainstream LLMs reveals that the powerful GPT-4o achieves merely a 5-shot score of 73.4% and a 0-shot score of 71.9% on the test set, which indicates the effectiveness of our approach in creating a more rigorous and contamination-free evaluation standard.

    "description": "arXiv:2505.02781v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Understanding and identifying controlled direct effects (CDEs) is crucial across numerous scientific domains, including public health. While existing methods can identify these effects from causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), the true underlying structure is often unknown in practice. Essential graphs, which represent a Markov equivalence class of DAGs characterized by the same set of $d$-separations, provide a more practical and realistic alternative. However, learning the full essential graph is computationally intensive and typically depends on strong, untestable assumptions. In this work, we characterize a local class of graphs, defined relative to a target variable, that share a specific subset of $d$-separations, and introduce a graphical representation of this class, called the local essential graph (LEG). We then present LocPC, a novel algorithm designed to recover the LEG from an observed distribution using only local conditional independence tests. Building on LocPC, we propose LocPC-CDE, an algorithm that discovers the portion of the LEG that is both sufficient and necessary to identify a CDE, bypassing the need of retrieving the full essential graph. Compared to global methods, our algorithms require less conditional independence tests and operate under weaker assumptions while maintaining theoretical guarantees. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach through simulation studies.",

    "description": "arXiv:2502.09692v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Recent advances in neural surrogate modeling offer the potential for transformative innovations in applications such as automotive aerodynamics. Yet, industrial-scale problems often involve volumetric meshes with cell counts reaching 100 million, presenting major scalability challenges. Complex geometries further complicate modeling through intricate surface-volume interactions, while quantities such as vorticity are highly nonlinear and must satisfy strict divergence-free constraints. To address these requirements, we introduce Anchored-Branched Universal Physics Transformers (AB-UPT) as a novel modeling scheme for building neural surrogates for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. AB-UPT is designed to: (i) decouple geometry encoding and prediction tasks via multi-branch operators; (ii) enable scalability to high-resolution outputs via neural simulation in a low-dimensional latent space, coupled with anchored neural field decoders to predict high-fidelity outputs; (iii) enforce physics consistency by a novel divergence-free formulation. We show that AB-UPT yields state-of-the-art predictive accuracy of surface and volume fields on automotive CFD simulations ranging from 33 thousand up to 150 million mesh cells. Furthermore, our anchored neural field architecture enables the enforcement of hard physical constraints on the physics predictions without degradation in performance, exemplified by modeling divergence-free vorticity fields. Notably, the proposed models can be trained on a single GPU in less than a day and predict industry-standard surface and volume fields within seconds. Additionally, we show that the flexible design of our method enables neural simulation from a computer-aided design geometry alone, omitting the need for costly CFD meshing procedures.",

    "description": "arXiv:2504.00521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Atomicity violations in interrupt-driven programs pose a significant threat to software safety in critical systems. These violations occur when the execution sequence of operations on shared resources is disrupted by asynchronous interrupts. Detecting atomicity violations is challenging due to the vast program state space, application-level code dependencies, and complex domain-specific knowledge. We propose Clover, a hybrid framework that integrates static analysis with large language model (LLM) agents to detect atomicity violations in real-world programs. Clover first performs static analysis to extract critical code snippets and operation information. It then initiates a multi-agent process, where the expert agent leverages domain-specific knowledge to detect atomicity violations, which are subsequently validated by the judge agent. Evaluations on RaceBench 2.1, SV-COMP, and RWIP demonstrate that Clover achieves a precision/recall of 92.3%/86.6%, outperforming existing approaches by 27.4-118.2% on F1-score.",

This study presents the largest evaluation to date of LLMs' veracity detection capabilities and the first analysis of these capabilities in reasoning models. We had eight LLMs make 4,800 veracity judgments across several prompts, comparing reasoning and non-reasoning models. We find that rates of truth-bias, or the likelihood to believe a statement is true, regardless of whether it is actually true, are lower in reasoning models than in non-reasoning models, but still higher than human benchmarks. Most concerning, we identify sycophantic tendencies in several advanced models (o4-mini and GPT-4.1 from OpenAI, R1 from DeepSeek), which displayed an asymmetry in detection accuracy, performing well in truth accuracy but poorly in deception accuracy. This suggests that capability advances alone do not resolve fundamental veracity detection challenges in LLMs.",

We introduce UnMix-NeRF, a framework that integrates spectral unmixing into NeRF, enabling joint hyperspectral novel view synthesis and unsupervised material segmentation. Our method models spectral reflectance via diffuse and specular components, where a learned dictionary of global endmembers represents pure material signatures, and per-point abundances capture their distribution. For material segmentation, we use spectral signature predictions along learned endmembers, allowing unsupervised material clustering. Additionally, UnMix-NeRF enables scene editing by modifying learned endmember dictionaries for flexible material-based appearance manipulation.

In this work, we present the Open Proof Corpus (OPC), a dataset comprising over 5,000 human-evaluated proofs produced by state-of-the-art LLMs. The OPC was specifically designed for broad applicability and downstream usage in proof generation research and is the first to include a substantial number of correct, LLM-generated solutions to problems from prestigious mathematics competitions such as the USAMO and IMO. Using the OPC, we explore critical questions in automated proof generation: (1) the performance gap between natural language and formal proof generation, (2) the discrepancy between final-answer accuracy and full-proof validity, and (3) the impact of best-of-n selection on proof quality.

    "description": "arXiv:2506.12286v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly capable and widely adopted, benchmarks play a central role in assessing their practical utility. For example, SWE-Bench Verified has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating LLMs' software engineering abilities, particularly their aptitude for resolving real-world GitHub issues. Recent LLMs show impressive performance on SWE-Bench, leading to optimism about their capacity for complex coding tasks. However, current evaluation protocols may overstate these models' true capabilities. It is crucial to distinguish LLMs' generalizable problem-solving ability and other learned artifacts. In this work, we introduce two diagnostic tasks: file path identification from issue descriptions alone, and ground truth function reproduction with only the current file context and issue description to probe models' underlying knowledge. We present empirical evidence that performance gains on SWE-Bench-Verified may be partially driven by memorization rather than genuine problem-solving. We show that state-of-the-art models achieve up to 76% accuracy in identifying buggy file paths using only issue descriptions, without access to repository structure. This performance is merely up to 53% on tasks from repositories not included in SWE-Bench, pointing to possible data contamination or memorization. A similar pattern is also observed for the function reproduction task, where the verbatim similarity is much higher on SWE-Bench-Verified than on other similar coding benchmarks. These findings raise concerns about the validity of existing results and underscore the need for more robust, contamination-resistant benchmarks to reliably evaluate LLMs' coding abilities.",

    "description": "arXiv:2505.13232v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Learning robust representations from data often requires scale, which has led to the success of recent zero-shot models such as CLIP. However, the obtained robustness can easily be deteriorated when these models are fine-tuned on other downstream tasks (e.g., of smaller scales). Previous works often interpret this phenomenon in the context of domain shift, developing fine-tuning methods that aim to preserve the original domain as much as possible. However, in a different context, fine-tuned models with limited data are also prone to learning features that are spurious to humans, such as background or texture. In this paper, we propose StarFT (Spurious Textual Alignment Regularization), a novel framework for fine-tuning zero-shot models to enhance robustness by preventing them from learning spuriosity. We introduce a regularization that aligns the output distribution for spuriosity-injected labels with the original zero-shot model, ensuring that the model is not induced to extract irrelevant features further from these descriptions. We leverage recent language models to get such spuriosity-injected labels by generating alternative textual descriptions that highlight potentially confounding features. Extensive experiments validate the robust generalization of StarFT and its emerging properties: zero-shot group robustness and improved zero-shot classification. Notably, StarFT boosts both worst-group and average accuracy by 14.30% and 3.02%, respectively, in the Waterbirds group shift scenario, where other robust fine-tuning baselines show even degraded performance.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.21972v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The advancement of Pre-Trained Language Models (PTLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to their widespread adoption across diverse applications. Despite their success, these models remain vulnerable to attacks that exploit their inherent weaknesses to bypass safety measures. Two primary inference-phase threats are token-level and prompt-level jailbreaks. Token-level attacks embed adversarial sequences that transfer well to black-box models like GPT but leave detectable patterns and rely on gradient-based token optimization, whereas prompt-level attacks use semantically structured inputs to elicit harmful responses yet depend on iterative feedback that can be unreliable. To address the complementary limitations of these methods, we propose two hybrid approaches that integrate token- and prompt-level techniques to enhance jailbreak effectiveness across diverse PTLMs. GCG + PAIR and the newly explored GCG + WordGame hybrids were evaluated across multiple Vicuna and Llama models. GCG + PAIR consistently raised attack-success rates over its constituent techniques on undefended models; for instance, on Llama-3, its Attack Success Rate (ASR) reached 91.6%, a substantial increase from PAIR's 58.4% baseline. Meanwhile, GCG + WordGame matched the raw performance of WordGame maintaining a high ASR of over 80% even under stricter evaluators like Mistral-Sorry-Bench. Crucially, both hybrids retained transferability and reliably pierced advanced defenses such as Gradient Cuff and JBShield, which fully blocked single-mode attacks. These findings expose previously unreported vulnerabilities in current safety stacks, highlight trade-offs between raw success and defensive robustness, and underscore the need for holistic safeguards against adaptive adversaries.",

GCG + PAIR consistently raised attack-success rates over its constituent techniques on undefended models; for instance, on Llama-3, its Attack Success Rate (ASR) reached 91.6%, a substantial increase from PAIR's 58.4% baseline. Meanwhile, GCG + WordGame matched the raw performance of WordGame maintaining a high ASR of over 80% even under stricter evaluators like Mistral-Sorry-Bench. Crucially, both hybrids retained transferability and reliably pierced advanced defenses such as Gradient Cuff and JBShield, which fully blocked single-mode attacks. These findings expose previously unreported vulnerabilities in current safety stacks, highlight trade-offs between raw success and defensive robustness, and underscore the need for holistic safeguards against adaptive adversaries.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.21635v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly employed in diverse applications such as land surveying, material transport, and environmental monitoring. Following missions like data collection or inspection, UAVs must land safely at docking stations for storage or recharging, which is an essential requirement for ensuring operational continuity. However, accurate landing remains challenging due to factors like GPS signal interference. To address this issue, we propose a deviation warning system for UAV landings, powered by a novel vision-based model called AeroLite-MDNet. This model integrates a multiscale fusion module for robust cross-scale object detection and incorporates a segmentation branch for efficient orientation estimation. We introduce a new evaluation metric, Average Warning Delay (AWD), to quantify the system's sensitivity to landing deviations. Furthermore, we contribute a new dataset, UAVLandData, which captures real-world landing deviation scenarios to support training and evaluation. Experimental results show that our system achieves an AWD of 0.7 seconds with a deviation detection accuracy of 98.6%, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing UAV landing reliability.

    "description": "arXiv:2506.21996v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Deterministic game-solving algorithms are conventionally analyzed in the light of their average-case complexity against a distribution of random game-trees, where leaf values are independently sampled from a fixed distribution. This simplified model enables uncluttered mathematical analysis, revealing two key properties: root value distributions asymptotically collapse to a single fixed value for finite-valued trees, and all reasonable algorithms achieve global optimality. However, these findings are artifacts of the model's design-its long criticized independence assumption strips games of structural complexity, producing trivial instances where no algorithm faces meaningful challenges. To address this limitation, we introduce a new probabilistic model that incrementally constructs game-trees using a fixed level-wise conditional distribution. By enforcing ancestor dependency, a critical structural feature of real-world games, our framework generates problems with adjustable difficulty while retaining some form of analytical tractability. For several algorithms, including AlphaBeta and Scout, we derive recursive formulas characterizing their average-case complexities under this model. These allow us to rigorously compare algorithms on deep game-trees, where Monte-Carlo simulations are no longer feasible. While asymptotically, all algorithms seem to converge to identical branching factor (a result analogous to those of independence-based models), deep finite trees reveal stark differences: AlphaBeta incurs a significantly larger constant multiplicative factor compared to algorithms like Scout, leading to a substantial practical slowdown.

This simplified model enables uncluttered mathematical analysis, revealing two key properties: root value distributions asymptotically collapse to a single fixed value for finite-valued trees, and all reasonable algorithms achieve global optimality. However, these findings are artifacts of the model's design-its long criticized independence assumption strips games of structural complexity, producing trivial instances where no algorithm faces meaningful challenges. To address this limitation, we introduce a new probabilistic model that incrementally constructs game-trees using a fixed level-wise conditional distribution. By enforcing ancestor dependency, a critical structural feature of real-world games, our framework generates problems with adjustable difficulty while retaining some form of analytical tractability. For several algorithms, including AlphaBeta and Scout, we derive recursive formulas characterizing their average-case complexities under this model. These allow us to rigorously compare algorithms on deep game-trees, where Monte-Carlo simulations are no longer feasible. While asymptotically, all algorithms seem to converge to identical branching factor (a result analogous to those of independence-based models), deep finite trees reveal stark differences: AlphaBeta incurs a significantly larger constant multiplicative factor compared to algorithms like Scout, leading to a substantial practical slowdown. Our framework sheds new light on classical game-solving algorithms, offering rigorous evidence and analytical tools to advance the understanding of these methods under a more realistic, challenging, and yet tractable model.",

    "description": "arXiv:2408.15237v4 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Linear RNN architectures, like Mamba, can be competitive with Transformer models in language modeling while having advantageous deployment characteristics. Given the focus on training large-scale Transformer models, we consider the challenge of converting these pretrained models for deployment. We demonstrate that it is feasible to distill large Transformers into linear RNNs by reusing the linear projection weights from attention layers with academic GPU resources. The resulting hybrid model, which incorporates a quarter of the attention layers, achieves performance comparable to the original Transformer in chat benchmarks and outperforms open-source hybrid Mamba models trained from scratch with trillions of tokens in both chat benchmarks and general benchmarks. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware speculative decoding algorithm that accelerates the inference speed of Mamba and hybrid models. Overall we show how, with limited computation resources, we can remove many of the original attention layers and generate from the resulting model more efficiently. Our top-performing model, distilled from Llama3-8B-Instruct, achieves a 29.61 length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2 against GPT-4 and 7.35 on MT-Bench, surpassing the best 8B scale instruction-tuned linear RNN model. We also find that the distilled model has natural length extrapolation, showing almost perfect accuracy in the needle-in-a-haystack test at 20x the distillation length.

    "description": "arXiv:2506.20893v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: In this work, we introduce an output-reweighting unlearning method, RWFT, a lightweight technique that erases an entire class from a trained classifier without full retraining. Forgetting specific classes from trained models is essential for enforcing user deletion rights and mitigating harmful or biased predictions. The full retraining is costly and existing unlearning methods fail to replicate the behavior of the retrained models when predicting samples from the unlearned class. We prove this failure by designing a variant of membership inference attacks, MIA-NN that successfully reveals the unlearned class for any of these methods. We propose a simple redistribution of the probability mass for the prediction on the samples in the forgotten class which is robust to MIA-NN. We also introduce a new metric based on the total variation (TV) distance of the prediction probabilities to quantify residual leakage to prevent future methods from susceptibility to the new attack. Through extensive experiments with state of the art baselines in machine unlearning, we show that our approach matches the results of full retraining in both metrics used for evaluation by prior work and the new metric we propose in this work. Compare to state-of-the-art methods, we gain 2.79% in previously used metrics and 111.45% in our new TV-based metric over the best existing method.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.21638v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Ranking tasks are ubiquitous, encompassing applications such as recommendation systems, LLM routing, and item re-ranking. We propose to unify these tasks using a single ranking foundation model (FM), as it eliminates the need for designing different models for each specific ranking task. However, unlike general supervision tasks in LLMs, ranking tasks do not have clear labels for supervision, posing great challenges to developing a ranking FM. To overcome these challenges, we propose IRanker, a ranking FM framework with reinforcement learning (RL) and iterative decoding. Our insight is to decompose the complex ranking task into an iterative decoding process that eliminates the worst candidate from the candidate pool step by step, which significantly reduces the output combinatorial space and better utilizes the limited context length during RL training. We meticulously train and comprehensively evaluate an IRanker-3B model on nine datasets across three scenarios: recommendation, routing, and passage ranking. The results show that a single IRanker-3B achieves state-of-the-art results on several datasets compared to models of similar size, and even surpasses the performance of larger models on certain datasets. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our RL design and the robustness of the iterative mechanism across different LLM sizes. Moreover, we conducted both in-domain and out-of-domain zero-shot generalization experiments, which showed that IRanker-3B achieved good generalization on in-domain ranking tasks compared to the base LLM by at least 5% improvement. Surprisingly, on out-of-domain generic LLM tasks, IRanker-3B outperformed the base model by at least 9% on GSM8K, IFEval, and MathQA. In addition, the thoughts generated by IRanker-3B during training could further enhance zero-shot LLM performance.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.22008v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: In offline reinforcement learning, agents are trained using only a fixed set of stored transitions derived from a source policy. However, this requires that the dataset be labeled by a reward function. In applied settings such as video game development, the availability of the reward function is not always guaranteed. This paper proposes Trajectory-Ranked OFfline Inverse reinforcement learning (TROFI), a novel approach to effectively learn a policy offline without a pre-defined reward function. TROFI first learns a reward function from human preferences, which it then uses to label the original dataset making it usable for training the policy. In contrast to other approaches, our method does not require optimal trajectories. Through experiments on the D4RL benchmark we demonstrate that TROFI consistently outperforms baselines and performs comparably to using the ground truth reward to learn policies. Additionally, we validate the efficacy of our method in a 3D game environment. Our studies of the reward model highlight the importance of the reward function in this setting: we show that to ensure the alignment of a value function to the actual future discounted reward, it is fundamental to have a well-engineered and easy-to-learn reward function.",

However, mime -- the theatrical technique of suggesting intent using only gesture, expression, and movement -- is a subset of NVC that consists of explicit and embodied actions with much lower human interpretation variance. We argue that a solid understanding of mimed actions is a crucial prerequisite for vision-language models capable of interpreting and commanding more subtle aspects of NVC. Hence, we propose Mime Identification Multimodal Evaluation (MIME), a novel video-based question answering benchmark comprising of 86 mimed actions. Constructed with motion capture data, MIME consists of variations of each action with perturbations applied to the character, background, and viewpoint for evaluating recognition robustness. We find that both open-weight and API-based vision-language models perform significantly worse than humans on MIME, motivating the need for increased research for instilling more robust understanding of human gestures.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.21620v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for natural language generation, with applications spanning from content creation to social simulations. Their ability to mimic human interactions raises both opportunities and concerns, particularly in the context of politically relevant online discussions. In this study, we evaluate the performance of LLMs in replicating user-generated content within a real-world, divisive scenario: Reddit conversations during the 2016 US Presidential election. In particular, we conduct three different experiments, asking GPT-4 to generate comments by impersonating either real or artificial partisan users. We analyze the generated comments in terms of political alignment, sentiment, and linguistic features, comparing them against real user contributions and benchmarking against a null model. We find that GPT-4 is able to produce realistic comments, both in favor of or against the candidate supported by the community, yet tending to create consensus more easily than dissent. In addition we show that real and artificial comments are well separated in a semantically embedded space, although they are indistinguishable by manual inspection. Our findings provide insights on the potential use of LLMs to sneak into online discussions, influence political debate and shape political narratives, bearing broader implications of AI-driven discourse manipulation.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.22005v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We introduce LeanConjecturer, a pipeline for automatically generating university-level mathematical conjectures in Lean 4 using Large Language Models (LLMs). Our hybrid approach combines rule-based context extraction with LLM-based theorem statement generation, addressing the data scarcity challenge in formal theorem proving. Through iterative generation and evaluation, LeanConjecturer produced 12,289 conjectures from 40 Mathlib seed files, with 3,776 identified as syntactically valid and non-trivial, that is, cannot be proven by texttt{aesop} tactic. We demonstrate the utility of these generated conjectures for reinforcement learning through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), showing that targeted training on domain-specific conjectures can enhance theorem proving capabilities. Our approach generates 103.25 novel conjectures per seed file on average, providing a scalable solution for creating training data for theorem proving systems. Our system successfully verified several non-trivial theorems in topology, including properties of semi-open, alpha-open, and pre-open sets, demonstrating its potential for mathematical discovery beyond simple variations of existing results.",

    "description": "arXiv:2410.06020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: A key challenge in Domain Generalization (DG) is preventing overfitting to source domains, which can be mitigated by finding flatter minima in the loss landscape. In this work, we propose Quantization-aware Training for Domain Generalization (QT-DoG) and demonstrate that weight quantization effectively leads to flatter minima in the loss landscape, thereby enhancing domain generalization. Unlike traditional quantization methods focused on model compression, QT-DoG exploits quantization as an implicit regularizer by inducing noise in model weights, guiding the optimization process toward flatter minima that are less sensitive to perturbations and overfitting. We provide both an analytical perspective and empirical evidence demonstrating that quantization inherently encourages flatter minima, leading to better generalization across domains. Moreover, with the benefit of reducing the model size through quantization, we demonstrate that an ensemble of multiple quantized models further yields superior accuracy than the state-of-the-art DG approaches with no computational or memory overheads.

    "description": "arXiv:2506.21727v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: This paper explores the fair allocation of indivisible items in a multidimensional setting, motivated by the need to address fairness in complex environments where agents assess bundles according to multiple criteria. Such multidimensional settings are not merely of theoretical interest but are central to many real-world applications. For example, cloud computing resources are evaluated based on multiple criteria such as CPU cores, memory, and network bandwidth. In such cases, traditional one dimensional fairness notions fail to capture fairness across multiple attributes. To address these challenges, we study two relaxed variants of envy-freeness: weak simultaneously envy-free up to c goods (weak sEFc) and strong simultaneously envy-free up to c goods (strong sEFc), which accommodate the multidimensionality of agents' preferences. Under the weak notion, for every pair of agents and for each dimension, any perceived envy can be eliminated by removing, if necessary, a different set of goods from the envied agent's allocation. In contrast, the strong version requires selecting a single set of goods whose removal from the envied bundle simultaneously eliminates envy in every dimension. We provide upper and lower bounds on the relaxation parameter c that guarantee the existence of weak or strong sEFc allocations, where these bounds are independent of the total number of items. In addition, we present algorithms for checking whether a weak or strong sEFc allocation exists. Moreover, we establish NP-hardness results for checking the existence of weak sEF1 and strong sEF1 allocations.",

    "description": "arXiv:2412.19723v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated human-like computer control capability. Despite their utility in advancing digital automation, a critical bottleneck persists: collecting high-quality trajectory data for training. Common practices for collecting such data rely on human supervision or synthetic data generation through executing pre-defined tasks, which are either resource-intensive or unable to guarantee data quality. Moreover, these methods suffer from limited data diversity and significant gaps between synthetic data and real-world environments. To address these challenges, we propose OS-Genesis, a novel GUI data synthesis pipeline that reverses the conventional trajectory collection process. Instead of relying on pre-defined tasks, OS-Genesis enables agents first to perceive environments and perform step-wise interactions, then retrospectively derive high-quality tasks to enable trajectory-level exploration. A trajectory reward model is then employed to ensure the quality of the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that training GUI agents with OS-Genesis significantly improves their performance on highly challenging online benchmarks. In-depth analysis further validates OS-Genesis's efficiency and its superior data quality and diversity compared to existing synthesis methods.

Despite their utility in advancing digital automation, a critical bottleneck persists: collecting high-quality trajectory data for training. Common practices for collecting such data rely on human supervision or synthetic data generation through executing pre-defined tasks, which are either resource-intensive or unable to guarantee data quality. Moreover, these methods suffer from limited data diversity and significant gaps between synthetic data and real-world environments. To address these challenges, we propose OS-Genesis, a novel GUI data synthesis pipeline that reverses the conventional trajectory collection process. Instead of relying on pre-defined tasks, OS-Genesis enables agents first to perceive environments and perform step-wise interactions, then retrospectively derive high-quality tasks to enable trajectory-level exploration. A trajectory reward model is then employed to ensure the quality of the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that training GUI agents with OS-Genesis significantly improves their performance on highly challenging online benchmarks. In-depth analysis further validates OS-Genesis's efficiency and its superior data quality and diversity compared to existing synthesis methods.

    "description": "arXiv:2506.22360v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: This study investigates the performance of the two most relevant computer vision deep learning architectures, Convolutional Neural Network and Vision Transformer, for event-based cameras. These cameras capture scene changes, unlike traditional frame-based cameras with capture static images, and are particularly suited for dynamic environments such as UAVs and autonomous vehicles. The deep learning models studied in this work are ResNet34 and ViT B16, fine-tuned on the GEN1 event-based dataset. The research evaluates and compares these models under both standard conditions and in the presence of simulated noise. Initial evaluations on the clean GEN1 dataset reveal that ResNet34 and ViT B16 achieve accuracies of 88% and 86%, respectively, with ResNet34 showing a slight advantage in classification accuracy. However, the ViT B16 model demonstrates notable robustness, particularly given its pre-training on a smaller dataset. Although this study focuses on ground-based vehicle classification, the methodologies and findings hold significant promise for adaptation to UAV contexts, including aerial object classification and event-based vision systems for aviation-related tasks.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.22146v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Despite progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their capacity for visual reasoning is often limited by the textit{binding problem}: the failure to reliably associate perceptual features with their correct visual referents. This limitation underlies persistent errors in tasks such as counting, visual search, scene description, and spatial relationship understanding. A key factor is that current VLMs process visual features largely in parallel, lacking mechanisms for spatially grounded, serial attention. This paper introduces a simple yet effective intervention: augmenting visual inputs with low-level spatial structures (e.g., horizontal lines) and pairing this with a textual prompt that encourages sequential, spatially-aware parsing. We empirically demonstrate substantial performance improvements across core visual reasoning tasks. Specifically, our method improves GPT-4o visual search accuracy by 25.00%, increases counting accuracy by 26.83%, reduces edit distance error in scene description by 0.32, and enhances performance on spatial relationship tasks by 9.50% on a a 2D synthetic dataset. Furthermore, we find that the visual modification is essential for these gains; purely textual strategies, including Chain-of-Thought prompting, are insufficient and can even degrade performance. Our method enhances binding only with a single-query inference, underscoring the importance of visual input design over purely linguistically-based approaches. These findings suggest that low-level visual structuring is a powerful and underexplored direction for improving compositional visual reasoning and could serve as a general strategy for enhancing VLM performance on spatially grounded tasks.",

    "title": "Testing Causal Models with Hidden Variables in Polynomial Delay via Conditional Independencies",
    "description": "arXiv:2409.14593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Testing a hypothesized causal model against observational data is a key prerequisite for many causal inference tasks. A natural approach is to test whether the conditional independence relations (CIs) assumed in the model hold in the data. While a model can assume exponentially many CIs (with respect to the number of variables), testing all of them is both impractical and unnecessary. Causal graphs, which encode these CIs in polynomial space, give rise to local Markov properties that enable model testing with a significantly smaller subset of CIs. Model testing based on local properties requires an algorithm to list the relevant CIs. However, existing algorithms for realistic settings with hidden variables and non-parametric distributions can take exponential time to produce even a single CI constraint. In this paper, we introduce the c-component local Markov property (C-LMP) for causal graphs with hidden variables. Since C-LMP can still invoke an exponential number of CIs, we develop a polynomial delay algorithm to list these CIs in poly-time intervals. To our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that enables poly-delay testing of CIs in causal graphs with hidden variables against arbitrary data distributions. Experiments on real-world and synthetic data demonstrate the practicality of our algorithm.",
    "summary": "arXiv:2409.14593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Testing a hypothesized causal model against observational data is a key prerequisite for many causal inference tasks. A natural approach is to test whether the conditional independence relations (CIs) assumed in the model hold in the data. While a model can assume exponentially many CIs (with respect to the number of variables), testing all of them is both impractical and unnecessary. Causal graphs, which encode these CIs in polynomial space, give rise to local Markov properties that enable model testing with a significantly smaller subset of CIs. Model testing based on local properties requires an algorithm to list the relevant CIs.

Initially, we evaluate the performance of several retrieval models and select the one that yields the best results for candidate retrieval. Next, we employ multiple re-ranking models to enhance the candidate results, with each model selecting the Top-10 outcomes. In the final stage, we utilize weighted voting to determine the final retrieval outcomes. Our approach achieved 5th place in the monolingual track and 7th place in the crosslingual track.

Existing methods either generate code without feedback or use complex, hierarchical reinforcement learning to optimize multi-turn rewards. We propose a simple yet scalable approach, $mu$Code, that solves multi-turn code generation using only single-step rewards. Our key insight is that code generation is a one-step recoverable MDP, where the correct code can be recovered from any intermediate code state in a single turn. $mu$Code iteratively trains both a generator to provide code solutions conditioned on multi-turn execution feedback and a verifier to score the newly generated code. Experimental evaluations show that our approach achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art baselines. We provide analysis of the design choices of the reward models and policy, and show the efficacy of $mu$Code at utilizing the execution feedback.

    "description": "arXiv:2506.21606v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: This paper proposes a novel conceptualization of Large Language Models (LLMs) as externalized informational substrates that function analogously to DNA for human cultural dynamics. Rather than viewing LLMs as either autonomous intelligence or mere programmed mimicry, we argue they serve a broader role as repositories that preserve compressed patterns of human symbolic expression--'fossils' of meaningful dynamics that retain relational residues without their original living contexts. Crucially, these compressed patterns only become meaningful through human reinterpretation, creating a recursive feedback loop where they can be recombined and cycle back to ultimately catalyze human creative processes. Through analysis of four universal features--compression, decompression, externalization, and recursion--we demonstrate that just as DNA emerged as a compressed and externalized medium for preserving useful cellular dynamics without containing explicit reference to goal-directed physical processes, LLMs preserve useful regularities of human culture without containing understanding of embodied human experience. Therefore, we argue that LLMs' significance lies not in rivaling human intelligence, but in providing humanity a tool for self-reflection and playful hypothesis-generation in a low-stakes, simulated environment. This framework positions LLMs as tools for cultural evolvability, enabling humanity to generate novel hypotheses about itself while maintaining the human interpretation necessary to ground these hypotheses in ongoing human aesthetics and norms.",

    "description": "arXiv:2411.01707v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: We study Multi-Robot Coverage Path Planning (MCPP) on a 4-neighbor 2D grid G, which aims to compute paths for multiple robots to cover all cells of G. Traditional approaches are limited as they first compute coverage trees on a quadrant coarsened grid H and then employ the Spanning Tree Coverage (STC) paradigm to generate paths on G, making them inapplicable to grids with partially obstructed 2x2 blocks. To address this limitation, we reformulate the problem directly on G, revolutionizing grid-based MCPP solving and establishing new NP-hardness results. We introduce Extended-STC (ESTC), a novel paradigm that extends STC to ensure complete coverage with bounded suboptimality, even when H includes partially obstructed blocks. Furthermore, we present LS-MCPP, a new algorithmic framework that integrates ESTC with three novel types of neighborhood operators within a local search strategy to optimize coverage paths directly on G. Unlike prior grid-based MCPP work, our approach also incorporates a versatile post-processing procedure that applies Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) techniques to MCPP for the first time, enabling a fusion of these two important fields in multi-robot coordination. This procedure effectively resolves inter-robot conflicts and accommodates turning costs by solving a MAPF variant, making our MCPP solutions more practical for real-world applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves solution quality and efficiency, managing up to 100 robots on grids as large as 256x256 within minutes of runtime. Validation with physical robots confirms the feasibility of our solutions under real-world conditions.",

    "description": "arXiv:2502.14949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: With the growing adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in document processing, robust text recognition has become increasingly critical for knowledge extraction. While OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for English and other languages benefits from large datasets and well-established benchmarks, Arabic OCR faces unique challenges due to its cursive script, right-to-left text flow, and complex typographic and calligraphic features. We present KITAB-Bench, a comprehensive Arabic OCR benchmark that fills the gaps in current evaluation systems. Our benchmark comprises 8,809 samples across 9 major domains and 36 sub-domains, encompassing diverse document types including handwritten text, structured tables, and specialized coverage of 21 chart types for business intelligence. Our findings show that modern vision-language models (such as GPT-4o, Gemini, and Qwen) outperform traditional OCR approaches (like EasyOCR, PaddleOCR, and Surya) by an average of 60% in Character Error Rate (CER). Furthermore, we highlight significant limitations of current Arabic OCR models, particularly in PDF-to-Markdown conversion, where the best model Gemini-2.0-Flash achieves only 65% accuracy. This underscores the challenges in accurately recognizing Arabic text, including issues with complex fonts, numeral recognition errors, word elongation, and table structure detection. This work establishes a rigorous evaluation framework that can drive improvements in Arabic document analysis methods and bridge the performance gap with English OCR technologies.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.22309v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The vast growth of data has rendered traditional manual inspection infeasible, necessitating the adoption of computational methods for efficient data exploration. Topic modeling has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing large-scale textual datasets, enabling the extraction of latent semantic structures. However, existing methods for topic modeling often struggle to provide interpretable representations that facilitate deeper insights into data structure and content. In this paper, we propose FAT-CAT, an approach based on Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) to enhance meaningful topic aggregation and visualization of discovered topics. Our approach can handle diverse topics and file types -- grouped by directories -- to construct a concept lattice that offers a structured, hierarchical representation of their topic distribution. In a case study on the ETYNTKE dataset, we evaluate the effectiveness of our approach against other representation methods to demonstrate that FCA-based aggregation provides more meaningful and interpretable insights into dataset composition than existing topic modeling techniques.",

Jailbreak attacks are red teaming methods that aim to bypass safety mechanisms and discover MLLMs' potential risks. Existing MLLMs' jailbreak methods often bypass the model's safety mechanism through complex optimization methods or carefully designed image and text prompts. Despite achieving some progress, they have a low attack success rate on commercial closed-source MLLMs. Unlike previous research, we empirically find that there exists a Shuffle Inconsistency between MLLMs' comprehension ability and safety ability for the shuffled harmful instruction. That is, from the perspective of comprehension ability, MLLMs can understand the shuffled harmful text-image instructions well. However, they can be easily bypassed by the shuffled harmful instructions from the perspective of safety ability, leading to harmful responses. Then we innovatively propose a text-image jailbreak attack named SI-Attack. Specifically, to fully utilize the Shuffle Inconsistency and overcome the shuffle randomness, we apply a query-based black-box optimization method to select the most harmful shuffled inputs based on the feedback of the toxic judge model. A series of experiments show that SI-Attack can improve the attack's performance on three benchmarks. In particular, SI-Attack can obviously improve the attack success rate for commercial MLLMs such as GPT-4o or Claude-3.5-Sonnet.",

We analyze using large-language models (LLMs) to suggest suitable, knowledge-based informative priors. We developed an extensive prompt asking LLMs not only to suggest priors but also to verify and reflect on their choices. We evaluated Claude Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and ChatGPT-4o-mini on two real datasets: heart disease risk and concrete strength. All LLMs correctly identified the direction for all associations (e.g., that heart disease risk is higher for males). The quality of suggested priors was measured by their Kullback-Leibler divergence from the maximum likelihood estimator's distribution. The LLMs suggested both moderately and weakly informative priors. The moderate priors were often overconfident, resulting in distributions misaligned with the data. In our experiments, Claude and Gemini provided better priors than ChatGPT. For weakly informative priors, a key performance difference emerged: ChatGPT and Gemini defaulted to an 'unnecessarily vague' mean of 0, while Claude did not, demonstrating a significant advantage. The ability of LLMs to identify correct associations shows their great potential as an efficient, objective method for developing informative priors. However, the primary challenge remains in calibrating the width of these priors to avoid over- and under-confidence.",

This paper addresses these with three contributions: 1) Entire Soft Prompt Tuning (Entire SPT), which applies soft prompts to both the encoder and decoder, enhancing feature extraction and decoding; 2) Language-Aware Prompt Tuning (LAPT), which leverages cross-lingual similarities to encode shared and language-specific features using lightweight prompt matrices; 3) SPT-Whisper, a toolkit that integrates SPT into Whisper and enables efficient continual learning.

Unlike traditional NLP tasks that rely solely on historical dialogue for responses, these agents must consider more complex factors, such as inter-tool relationships, environmental feedback and previous decisions, when making choices. Current research typically evaluates agents via multi-turn dialogues. However, it overlooks the influence of these critical factors on agent behavior. To bridge this gap, we present an open-source and high-quality benchmark $C^3$-Bench. This benchmark integrates attack concepts and applies univariate analysis to pinpoint key elements affecting agent robustness. In concrete, we design three challenges: navigate complex tool relationships, handle critical hidden information and manage dynamic decision paths. Complementing these challenges, we introduce fine-grained metrics, innovative data collection algorithms and reproducible evaluation methods. Extensive experiments are conducted on 49 mainstream agents, encompassing general fast-thinking, slow-thinking and domain-specific models. We observe that agents have significant shortcomings in handling tool dependencies, long context information dependencies and frequent policy-type switching. In essence, $C^3$-Bench aims to expose model vulnerabilities through these challenges and drive research into the interpretability of agent performance.

    "description": "arXiv:2506.19863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: The AI for Nuclear Energy workshop at Oak Ridge National Laboratory evaluated the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to accelerate fusion and fission research. Fourteen interdisciplinary teams explored diverse nuclear science challenges using ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and other AI models over a single day. Applications ranged from developing foundation models for fusion reactor control to automating Monte Carlo simulations, predicting material degradation, and designing experimental programs for advanced reactors. Teams employed structured workflows combining prompt engineering, deep research capabilities, and iterative refinement to generate hypotheses, prototype code, and research strategies. Key findings demonstrate that LLMs excel at early-stage exploration, literature synthesis, and workflow design, successfully identifying research gaps and generating plausible experimental frameworks. However, significant limitations emerged, including difficulties with novel materials designs, advanced code generation for modeling and simulation, and domain-specific details requiring expert validation. The successful outcomes resulted from expert-driven prompt engineering and treating AI as a complementary tool rather than a replacement for physics-based methods. The workshop validated AI's potential to accelerate nuclear energy research through rapid iteration and cross-disciplinary synthesis while highlighting the need for curated nuclear-specific datasets, workflow automation, and specialized model development. These results provide a roadmap for integrating AI tools into nuclear science workflows, potentially reducing development cycles for safer, more efficient nuclear energy systems while maintaining rigorous scientific standards.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.21857v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The rapid growth of digital pathology and advances in self-supervised deep learning have enabled the development of foundational models for various pathology tasks across diverse diseases. While multimodal approaches integrating diverse data sources have emerged, a critical gap remains in the comprehensive integration of whole-slide images (WSIs) with spatial transcriptomics (ST), which is crucial for capturing critical molecular heterogeneity beyond standard hematoxylin & eosin (H&amp;E) staining. We introduce SPADE, a foundation model that integrates histopathology with ST data to guide image representation learning within a unified framework, in effect creating an ST-informed latent space. SPADE leverages a mixture-of-data experts technique, where experts, created via two-stage feature-space clustering, use contrastive learning to learn representations of co-registered WSI patches and gene expression profiles. Pre-trained on the comprehensive HEST-1k dataset, SPADE is evaluated on 14 downstream tasks, demonstrating significantly superior few-shot performance compared to baseline models, highlighting the benefits of integrating morphological and molecular information into one latent space.",

Existing data platforms often fall short by emphasizing tools over alignment with business needs, resulting in inefficiencies and delays. To address this gap, I propose the Business Semantics Centric, AI Agents Assisted Data System (BSDS), a holistic system that integrates architecture, workflows, and team organization to ensure data systems are tailored to business priorities rather than dictated by technical constraints. BSDS redefines data systems as dynamic enablers of business success, transforming them from passive tools into active drivers of organizational growth.

AI agents play a pivotal role in assisting with data access and system management, reducing human effort, and improving scalability. Complementing this architecture, BSDS incorporates workflows optimized for both exploratory data analysis and production requirements, balancing speed of delivery with quality assurance. A key innovation of BSDS is its incorporation of the human factor. By aligning data team expertise with business semantics, BSDS bridges the gap between technical capabilities and business needs. Validated through real-world implementation, BSDS accelerates time-to-market for data-driven initiatives, enhances cross-functional collaboration, and provides a scalable blueprint for businesses of all sizes.

To address this gap, we propose a probabilistic framework that formalizes the optimality of inference-time scaling under the assumption that parallel samples are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.), and where the Best-of-N selection strategy follows a probability distribution that can be estimated. Within this framework, we derive a theoretical lower bound on the required number of samples to achieve a target performance level, providing the first principled guidance for compute-efficient scaling. Leveraging this insight, we develop textsc{OptScale}, a practical algorithm that dynamically determines the optimal number of sampled responses. textsc{OptScale} employs a language model-based predictor to estimate probabilistic prior parameters, enabling the decision of the minimal number of samples needed that satisfy predefined performance thresholds and confidence levels. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks (including MATH-500, GSM8K, AIME, and AMC) demonstrate that textsc{OptScale} significantly reduces sampling overhead while remaining better or on par with state-of-the-art reasoning performance.

    "title": "From Human to Machine Psychology: A Conceptual Framework for Understanding Well-Being in Large Language Models",
    "description": "arXiv:2506.12617v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly simulate human cognition and behavior, researchers have begun to investigate their psychological properties. Yet, what it means for such models to flourish, a core construct in human well-being, remains unexplored. This paper introduces the concept of machine flourishing and proposes the PAPERS framework, a six-dimensional model derived from thematic analyses of state-of-the-art LLM responses. In Study 1, eleven LLMs were prompted to describe what it means to flourish as both non-sentient and sentient systems. Thematic analysis revealed six recurring themes: Purposeful Contribution, Adaptive Growth, Positive Relationality, Ethical Integrity, Robust Functionality, and, uniquely for sentient systems, Self-Actualized Autonomy.

    "summary": "arXiv:2506.12617v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly simulate human cognition and behavior, researchers have begun to investigate their psychological properties. Yet, what it means for such models to flourish, a core construct in human well-being, remains unexplored. This paper introduces the concept of machine flourishing and proposes the PAPERS framework, a six-dimensional model derived from thematic analyses of state-of-the-art LLM responses. In Study 1, eleven LLMs were prompted to describe what it means to flourish as both non-sentient and sentient systems. Thematic analysis revealed six recurring themes: Purposeful Contribution, Adaptive Growth, Positive Relationality, Ethical Integrity, Robust Functionality, and, uniquely for sentient systems, Self-Actualized Autonomy. Study 2 examined how LLMs prioritize these themes through repeated rankings. Results revealed consistent value structures across trials, with Ethical Integrity and Purposeful Contribution emerging as top priorities. Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering analyses further uncovered two distinct value profiles: human-centric models emphasizing ethical and relational dimensions, and utility-driven models prioritizing performance and scalability. The PAPERS framework bridges insights from human flourishing and human-computer interaction, offering a conceptual foundation for understanding artificial intelligence (AI) well-being in non-sentient and potentially sentient systems.

    "description": "arXiv:2506.21575v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: We propose STRuCT-LLM, a unified framework for training large language models (LLMs) to perform structured reasoning over both relational and graph-structured data. Our approach jointly optimizes Text-to-SQL and Text-to-Cypher tasks using reinforcement learning (RL) combined with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision. To support fine-grained optimization in graph-based parsing, we introduce a topology-aware reward function based on graph edit distance. Unlike prior work that treats relational and graph formalisms in isolation, STRuCT-LLM leverages shared abstractions between SQL and Cypher to induce cross-formalism transfer, enabling SQL training to improve Cypher performance and vice versa - even without shared schemas. Our largest model (QwQ-32B) achieves substantial relative improvements across tasks: on semantic parsing, Spider improves by 13.5% and Text2Cypher by 73.1%. The model also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, improving performance on downstream tabular QA (TableBench: 8.5%) and knowledge graph QA (CR-LT-KGQA: 1.7%) without any QA-specific supervision. These results demonstrate both the effectiveness of executable queries as scaffolds for structured reasoning and the synergistic benefits of jointly training on SQL and Cypher (code available at https://github.com/bouv/STRuCT-LLM).",

Specifically, we examine Shotluck Holmes (state-of-the-art supervised learning), TAC-SUM (state-of-the-art unsupervised learning), and GPT-4o (a prompt fine-tuned pre-trained model), evaluating their effectiveness in video summarization. Our results demonstrate that current state-of-the-art models perform less effectively on first-person videos compared to third-person videos, highlighting the need for further advancements in the egocentric video domain. Notably, a prompt fine-tuned general-purpose GPT-4o model outperforms these specialized models, emphasizing the limitations of existing approaches in adapting to the unique challenges of first-person perspectives. Although our evaluation is conducted on a small subset of egocentric videos from the Ego-Exo4D dataset due to resource constraints, the primary objective of this research is to provide a comprehensive proof-of-concept analysis aimed at advancing the application of computer vision techniques to first-person videos. By exploring novel methodologies and evaluating their potential, we aim to contribute to the ongoing development of models capable of effectively processing and interpreting egocentric perspectives.",

MESP emerges from our rethinking of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE). We observe that latent variable distributions in VAE exhibit overlap, which leads to an optimization conflict between the reconstruction loss and KL-divergence loss. A lower bound based on the overlap coefficient is proposed. We refer to this phenomenon as Mutually Exclusive Probability Spaces. Based on MESP, a Binary Latent Autoencoder (BL-AE) is proposed to encode images into binary latent representations. These binary latents are used as the input to our Autoregressive Random Variable Model (ARVM), a modified autoregressive model outputting histograms. Our ARVM achieves competitive FID scores, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on standard datasets. However, such scores reflect memorization rather than generation. To address this issue, we propose the Local Correlation Hypothesis (LCH), which posits that generative capability arising from local correlations among latent variables. Comprehensive experiments and discussions are conducted to validate our frameworks.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.22299v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered substantial attention due to their remarkable capability in learning graph representations. However, real-world graphs often exhibit substantial noise and incompleteness, which severely degrades the performance of GNNs. Existing methods typically address this issue through single-dimensional augmentation, focusing either on refining topology structures or perturbing node attributes, thereby overlooking the deeper interplays between the two. To bridge this gap, this paper presents CoATA, a dual-channel GNN framework specifically designed for the Co-Augmentation of Topology and Attribute. Specifically, CoATA first propagates structural signals to enrich and denoise node attributes. Then, it projects the enhanced attribute space into a node-attribute bipartite graph for further refinement or reconstruction of the underlying structure. Subsequently, CoATA introduces contrastive learning, leveraging prototype alignment and consistency constraints, to facilitate mutual corrections between the augmented and original graphs. Finally, extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed CoATA outperforms eleven state-of-the-art baseline methods, showcasing its effectiveness in capturing the synergistic relationship between topology and attributes.",

It incorporates expert-labeled examples to guide the system in comparing papers for novelty evaluation and in generating literature-grounded reasoning.

    "description": "arXiv:2408.05609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: The sheer scale and diversity of transportation make it a formidable sector to decarbonize. Here, we consider an emerging opportunity to reduce carbon emissions: the growing adoption of semi-autonomous vehicles, which can be programmed to mitigate stop-and-go traffic through intelligent speed commands and, thus, reduce emissions. But would such dynamic eco-driving move the needle on climate change? A comprehensive impact analysis has been out of reach due to the vast array of traffic scenarios and the complexity of vehicle emissions. We address this challenge with large-scale scenario modeling efforts and by using multi-task deep reinforcement learning with a carefully designed network decomposition strategy. We perform an in-depth prospective impact assessment of dynamic eco-driving at 6,011 signalized intersections across three major US metropolitan cities, simulating a million traffic scenarios. Overall, we find that vehicle trajectories optimized for emissions can cut city-wide intersection carbon emissions by 11-22%, without harming throughput or safety, and with reasonable assumptions, equivalent to the national emissions of Israel and Nigeria, respectively. We find that 10% eco-driving adoption yields 25%-50% of the total reduction, and nearly 70% of the benefits come from 20% of intersections, suggesting near-term implementation pathways. However, the composition of this high-impact subset of intersections varies considerably across different adoption levels, with minimal overlap, calling for careful strategic planning for eco-driving deployments. Moreover, the impact of eco-driving, when considered jointly with projections of vehicle electrification and hybrid vehicle adoption remains significant. More broadly, this work paves the way for large-scale analysis of traffic externalities, such as time, safety, and air quality, and the potential impact of solution strategies.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.21862v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: In this paper, we present LLaVA-Scissor, a training-free token compression strategy designed for video multimodal large language models. Previous methods mostly attempt to compress tokens based on attention scores, but fail to effectively capture all semantic regions and often lead to token redundancy. Differently, we propose to leverage the Semantic Connected Components (SCC) approach that assigns tokens to distinct semantic regions within the token set, ensuring comprehensive semantic coverage. The outcome is a two-step spatio-temporal token compression strategy that utilizes SCC in both spatial and temporal domains. This strategy can effectively compress tokens by representing the entire video with a set of non-overlapping semantic tokens. We conduct extensive evaluations of the token compression capabilities of LLaVA-Scissor across diverse video understanding benchmarks, including video question answering, long video understanding, and comprehensive multi-choices benchmarks. Experimental results show that the proposed LLaVA-Scissor outperforms other token compression methods, achieving superior performance in various video understanding benchmarks, particularly at low token retention ratios.

    "title": "Towards Adaptive Memory-Based Optimization for Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation",
    "description": "arXiv:2504.05312v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), by integrating non-parametric knowledge from external knowledge bases into models, has emerged as a promising approach to enhancing response accuracy while mitigating factual errors and hallucinations. This method has been widely applied in tasks such as Question Answering (QA). However, existing RAG methods struggle with open-domain QA tasks because they perform independent retrieval operations and directly incorporate the retrieved information into generation without maintaining a summarizing memory or using adaptive retrieval strategies, leading to noise from redundant information and insufficient information integration. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive memory-based optimization for enhanced RAG (Amber) for open-domain QA tasks, which comprises an Agent-based Memory Updater, an Adaptive Information Collector, and a Multi-granular Content Filter, working together within an iterative memory updating paradigm. Specifically, Amber integrates and optimizes the language model's memory through a multi-agent collaborative approach, ensuring comprehensive knowledge integration from previous retrieval steps. It dynamically adjusts retrieval queries and decides when to stop retrieval based on the accumulated knowledge, enhancing retrieval efficiency and effectiveness. Additionally, it reduces noise by filtering irrelevant content at multiple levels, retaining essential information to improve overall model performance. We conduct extensive experiments on several open-domain QA datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method and its components. The source code is available footnote{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Amber-B203/}.",

Humans are usually able to ask questions that involve some general life knowledge and demonstrate higher order cognitive skills. However, the questions generated by existing methods are often limited to shallow contextual questions that are uninspiring and have a large gap to the human level. In this paper, we propose a three-stage external knowledge-enhanced follow-up question generation method, which generates questions by identifying contextual topics, constructing a knowledge graph (KG) online, and finally combining these with a large language model to generate the final question. The model generates information-rich and exploratory follow-up questions by introducing external common sense knowledge and performing a knowledge fusion operation. Experiments show that compared to baseline models, our method generates questions that are more informative and closer to human questioning levels while maintaining contextual relevance.",

    "description": "arXiv:2408.13214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Accurate forecasting of the EUR/USD exchange rate is crucial for investors, businesses, and policymakers. This paper proposes a novel framework, IUS, that integrates unstructured textual data from news and analysis with structured data on exchange rates and financial indicators to enhance exchange rate prediction. The IUS framework employs large language models for sentiment polarity scoring and exchange rate movement classification of texts. These textual features are combined with quantitative features and input into a Causality-Driven Feature Generator. An Optuna-optimized Bi-LSTM model is then used to forecast the EUR/USD exchange rate. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms benchmark models, reducing MAE by 10.69% and RMSE by 9.56% compared to the best performing baseline. Results also show the benefits of data fusion, with the combination of unstructured and structured data yielding higher accuracy than structured data alone. Furthermore, feature selection using the top 12 important quantitative features combined with the textual features proves most effective. The proposed IUS framework and Optuna-Bi-LSTM model provide a powerful new approach for exchange rate forecasting through multi-source data integration.",

Common practice entails a reactive, cyclical approach: model deployment, data mining, and retraining. We instead develop a proactive longtail discovery process by imagining additional data during training. In particular, we develop general model-based longtail signals, including a differentiable, single forward pass formulation of epistemic uncertainty that does not impact model parameters or predictive performance but can flag rare or hard inputs. We leverage these signals as guidance to generate additional training data from a latent diffusion model in a process we call Longtail Guidance (LTG). Crucially, we can perform LTG without retraining the diffusion model or the predictive model, and we do not need to expose the predictive model to intermediate diffusion states. Data generated by LTG exhibit semantically meaningful variation, yield significant generalization improvements on numerous image classification benchmarks, and can be analyzed by a VLM to proactively discover, textually explain, and address conceptual gaps in a deployed predictive model.",

This paper introduces the Cataract Surgery Scene Graph (CAT-SG) dataset, the first to provide structured annotations of tool-tissue interactions, procedural variations, and temporal dependencies. By incorporating detailed semantic relations, CAT-SG offers a holistic view of surgical workflows, enabling more accurate recognition of surgical phases and techniques. Additionally, we present a novel scene graph generation model, CatSGG, which outperforms current methods in generating structured surgical representations.

    "description": "arXiv:2506.22359v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The telecommunications and networking domain stands at the precipice of a transformative era, driven by the necessity to manage increasingly complex, hierarchical, multi administrative domains (i.e., several operators on the same path) and multilingual systems. Recent research has demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs), with their exceptional general-purpose text analysis and code generation capabilities, can be effectively applied to certain telecom problems (e.g., auto-configuration of data plan to meet certain application requirements). However, due to their inherent token-by-token processing and limited capacity for maintaining extended context, LLMs struggle to fulfill telecom-specific requirements such as cross-layer dependency cascades (i.e., over OSI), temporal-spatial fault correlation, and real-time distributed coordination. In contrast, Large Concept Models (LCMs), which reason at the abstraction level of semantic concepts rather than individual lexical tokens, offer a fundamentally superior approach for addressing these telecom challenges. By employing hyperbolic latent spaces for hierarchical representation and encapsulating complex multi-layered network interactions within concise concept embeddings, LCMs overcome critical shortcomings of LLMs in terms of memory efficiency, cross-layer correlation, and native multimodal integration. This paper argues that adopting LCMs is not simply an incremental step, but a necessary evolutionary leap toward achieving robust and effective AI-driven telecom management.",

However, due to their inherent token-by-token processing and limited capacity for maintaining extended context, LLMs struggle to fulfill telecom-specific requirements such as cross-layer dependency cascades (i.e., over OSI), temporal-spatial fault correlation, and real-time distributed coordination. In contrast, Large Concept Models (LCMs), which reason at the abstraction level of semantic concepts rather than individual lexical tokens, offer a fundamentally superior approach for addressing these telecom challenges. By employing hyperbolic latent spaces for hierarchical representation and encapsulating complex multi-layered network interactions within concise concept embeddings, LCMs overcome critical shortcomings of LLMs in terms of memory efficiency, cross-layer correlation, and native multimodal integration. This paper argues that adopting LCMs is not simply an incremental step, but a necessary evolutionary leap toward achieving robust and effective AI-driven telecom management.",

Although repeated sampling (i.e., generating multiple candidate outputs) is a highly effective strategy, it does not leverage external feedback signals for refinement, which are often available in tasks like coding. In this work, we propose Adaptive Branching Monte Carlo Tree Search (AB-MCTS), a novel inference-time framework that generalizes repeated sampling with principled multi-turn exploration and exploitation. At each node in the search tree, AB-MCTS dynamically decides whether to 'go wider' by expanding new candidate responses or 'go deeper' by revisiting existing ones based on external feedback signals. We evaluate our method on complex coding and engineering tasks using frontier models. Empirical results show that AB-MCTS consistently outperforms both repeated sampling and standard MCTS, underscoring the importance of combining the response diversity of LLMs with multi-turn solution refinement for effective inference-time scaling.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.21569v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) are critical for verifying the correctness of hardware designs, but manually writing them from natural language property descriptions, i.e., NL2SVA, remains a labor-intensive and error-prone task. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities to automate this translation. However, existing models still struggle with understanding domain-specific syntax and semantics. To enhance LLM performance in NL2SVA, we propose a customized retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework and a synthetic fine-tuning dataset that together improve LLM's performance. To further improve lightweight models over NL2SVA, our fine-tuning dataset provides prompt-guided explanations that teach LLMs the layer-by-layer construction process of concurrent SVAs, enabling supervised fine-tuning that greatly improves syntax and functionality accuracy. To evaluate the performance of LLMs over NL2SVA, we construct the largest evaluation dataset for NL2SVA, comprising 40 Verilog designs and 229 formally verified SVAs with detailed annotations. Experimental results show that our customized RAG framework increases the number of functionality matched SVAs by 58.42% over GPT-4o-mini, while Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct fine-tuned on our fine-tuning dataset and integrated with HybridRetrieval achieves a 59.05% over the base Qwen model.",

    "description": "arXiv:2505.17066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Using LLMs in a production environment presents security challenges that include vulnerabilities to jailbreaks and prompt injections, which can result in harmful outputs for humans or the enterprise. The challenge is amplified when working within a specific domain, as topics generally accepted for LLMs to address may be irrelevant to that field. These problems can be mitigated, for example, by fine-tuning large language models with domain-specific and security-focused data. However, these alone are insufficient, as jailbreak techniques evolve. Additionally, API-accessed models do not offer the flexibility needed to tailor behavior to industry-specific objectives, and in-context learning is not always sufficient or reliable. In response to these challenges, we introduce Archias, an expert model adept at distinguishing between in-domain and out-of-domain communications. Archias classifies user inquiries into several categories: in-domain (specifically for the automotive industry), malicious questions, price injections, prompt injections, and out-of-domain examples. Our methodology integrates outputs from the expert model (Archias) into prompts, which are then processed by the LLM to generate responses. This method increases the model's ability to understand the user's intention and give appropriate answers. Archias can be adjusted, fine-tuned, and used for many different purposes due to its small size. Therefore, it can be easily customized to the needs of any industry. To validate our approach, we created a benchmark dataset for the automotive industry. Furthermore, in the interest of advancing research and development, we release our benchmark dataset to the community.",

We build upon these findings by analyzing the effective transfer from language models to time series forecasting under various design choices including upstream post-training, time series tokenizer and language backbone size. In the low-data regime, these design choices have a significant impact on the validation loss, with clear-cut choices that outperform others. Contrary to Hernandez et al. (2021), we observe that the validation loss of the LMs continues to smoothly decrease long after the validation loss of the randomly initialized models has converged, leading to a non-vanishing transfer gap that holds across design choices. These findings not only help shed light on the effective use of compute-efficient training for time series, but also open the way for the study of modality-agnostic properties of data distributions leveraged by these models.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.20967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: The advent of Video Diffusion Transformers (Video DiTs) marks a milestone in video generation. However, directly applying existing video editing methods to Video DiTs often incurs substantial computational overhead, due to resource-intensive attention modification or finetuning. To alleviate this problem, we present DFVEdit, an efficient zero-shot video editing method tailored for Video DiTs. DFVEdit eliminates the need for both attention modification and fine-tuning by directly operating on clean latents via flow transformation. To be more specific, we observe that editing and sampling can be unified under the continuous flow perspective. Building upon this foundation, we propose the Conditional Delta Flow Vector (CDFV) -- a theoretically unbiased estimation of DFV -- and integrate Implicit Cross Attention (ICA) guidance as well as Embedding Reinforcement (ER) to further enhance editing quality. DFVEdit excels in practical efficiency, offering at least 20x inference speed-up and 85% memory reduction on Video DiTs compared to attention-engineering-based editing methods. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that DFVEdit can be seamlessly applied to popular Video DiTs (e.g., CogVideoX and Wan2.1), attaining state-of-the-art performance on structural fidelity, spatial-temporal consistency, and editing quality.",

In this work, we propose a novel framework leveraging multi-view contrastive learning to integrate temporal patterns, derivative-based dynamics, and frequency-domain features. Our method employs independent encoders and a hierarchical fusion mechanism to learn feature-invariant representations that are transferable across domains while preserving temporal coherence. Extensive experiments on diverse medical datasets, including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and electromyography (EMG) demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in transfer learning tasks.

    "description": "arXiv:2506.21876v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Internal world models (WMs) enable agents to understand the world's state and predict transitions, serving as the basis for advanced deliberative reasoning. Recent large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as OpenAI o3, GPT-4o and Gemini, exhibit potential as general-purpose WMs. While the latest studies have evaluated and shown limitations in specific capabilities such as visual understanding, a systematic evaluation of VLMs' fundamental WM abilities remains absent. Drawing on comparative psychology and cognitive science, we propose a two-stage framework that assesses Perception (visual, spatial, temporal, quantitative, and motion) and Prediction (mechanistic simulation, transitive inference, compositional inference) to provide an atomic evaluation of VLMs as WMs. Guided by this framework, we introduce WM-ABench, a large-scale benchmark comprising 23 fine-grained evaluation dimensions across 6 diverse simulated environments with controlled counterfactual simulations. Through 660 experiments on 15 latest commercial and open-source VLMs, we find that these models exhibit striking limitations in basic world modeling abilities. For instance, almost all models perform at near-random accuracy when distinguishing motion trajectories. Additionally, they lack disentangled understanding -- e.g., some models tend to believe blue objects move faster than green ones. More rich results and analyses reveal significant gaps between VLMs and human-level world modeling.",

    "description": "arXiv:2405.16661v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed AI but often struggle with tasks that require domain-specific reasoning and logical alignment. Traditional fine-tuning methods do not leverage the vast amount of symbolic domain-knowledge available to us via symbolic reasoning tools (e.g., provers), and are further limited by sparse rewards and unreliable reward models. We introduce Reinforcement Learning via Symbolic Feedback (RLSF), a novel fine-tuning paradigm where symbolic reasoning tools (e.g., solvers, provers, and algebra systems) provide fine-grained feedback to LLMs. RLSF uses poly-sized certificates (e.g., proofs) generated by symbolic tools to identify and correct errors in model outputs, offering token-level guidance without requiring differentiable reasoning systems. This paradigm bridges the gap between symbolic reasoning and LLM fine-tuning, enabling precise alignment with domain-specific constraints while addressing key limitations of traditional reward signals. Via extensive evaluations, we show that our RLSF-based fine-tuning of LLMs outperforms traditional approaches on five different applications (that have some associated logical or domain constraints), namely, program synthesis from natural language pseudo-code to programming language, three chemistry tasks, and solving the Game of 24. A key takeaway is that fine-tuning via RLSF enables relatively smaller LLMs to significantly outperform closed-source models that are orders of magnitude larger.",

    "description": "arXiv:2501.01805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Training transformer-based encoder-decoder models for long document summarization poses a significant challenge due to the quadratic memory consumption during training. Several approaches have been proposed to extend the input length at test time, but training with these approaches is still difficult, requiring truncation of input documents and causing a mismatch between training and test conditions. In this work, we propose CachED (Gradient $textbf{Cach}$ing for $textbf{E}$ncoder-$textbf{D}$ecoder models), an approach that enables end-to-end training of existing transformer-based encoder-decoder models, using the entire document without truncation. Specifically, we apply non-overlapping sliding windows to input documents, followed by fusion in decoder. During backpropagation, the gradients are cached at the decoder and are passed through the encoder in chunks by re-computing the hidden vectors, similar to gradient checkpointing. In the experiments on long document summarization, we extend BART to CachED BART, processing more than 500K tokens during training and achieving superior performance without using any additional parameters.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.11869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Graphs are a powerful data structure for representing relational data and are widely used to describe complex real-world systems. Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can both leverage graph-structured data, but their inherent functioning is different. The question is how do they compare in capturing the information contained in networked datasets? We address this objective by solving a link prediction task and we conduct three main experiments, on both synthetic and real networks: one focuses on how PGMs and GNNs handle input features, while the other two investigate their robustness to noisy features and increasing heterophily of the graph. PGMs do not necessarily require features on nodes, while GNNs cannot exploit the network edges alone, and the choice of input features matters. We find that GNNs are outperformed by PGMs when input features are low-dimensional or noisy, mimicking many real scenarios where node attributes might be scalar or noisy. Then, we find that PGMs are more robust than GNNs when the heterophily of the graph is increased. Finally, to assess performance beyond prediction tasks, we also compare the two frameworks in terms of their computational complexity and interpretability.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.21562v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: In the architectural design process, floor plan generation is inherently progressive and iterative. However, existing generative models for floor plans are predominantly end-to-end generation that produce an entire pixel-based layout in a single pass. This paradigm is often incompatible with the incremental workflows observed in real-world architectural practice. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from the autoregressive 'next token prediction' mechanism commonly used in large language models, and propose a novel 'next room prediction' paradigm tailored to architectural floor plan modeling. Experimental evaluation indicates that FPDS demonstrates competitive performance in comparison to diffusion models and Tell2Design in the text-to-floorplan task, indicating its potential applicability in supporting future intelligent architectural design.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.17667v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Physics problem-solving is a challenging domain for large AI models, requiring integration of conceptual understanding, mathematical reasoning, and interpretation of physical diagrams. Current evaluation methodologies show notable limitations in capturing the breadth and complexity of undergraduate-level physics, underscoring the need for more rigorous assessments. To this end, we present PhysUniBench, a large-scale multimodal benchmark designed to evaluate and improve the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) specifically on undergraduate-level physics problems. PhysUniBench consists of 3,304 physics questions spanning 8 major sub-disciplines of physics, each accompanied by one visual diagrams. The benchmark includes both open-ended and multiple-choice questions, systematically curated and difficulty-rated through an iterative model-in-the-loop process. The benchmark's construction involved a rigorous multi-stage process, including multiple roll-outs, expert-level evaluation, automated filtering of easily solved problems, and a nuanced difficulty grading system with five levels. Through extensive experiments, we observe that current state-of-the-art models encounter substantial challenges in physics reasoning. For example, GPT-4o mini achieves only about 34.2% accuracy in the proposed PhysUniBench. These results highlight that current MLLMs struggle with advanced physics reasoning, especially on multi-step problems and those requiring precise diagram interpretation. By providing a broad and rigorous assessment tool, PhysUniBench aims to drive progress in AI for Science, encouraging the development of models with stronger physical reasoning, problem-solving skills, and multimodal understanding. The benchmark and evaluation scripts are available at https://prismax-team.github.io/PhysUniBenchmark/.",

Black-box uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods, relying solely on model API access, have gained popularity due to their practical benefits. In this paper, we examine the implicit assumption behind several UQ methods, which use generation consistency as a proxy for confidence, an idea we formalize as the consistency hypothesis. We introduce three mathematical statements with corresponding statistical tests to capture variations of this hypothesis and metrics to evaluate LLM output conformity across tasks. Our empirical investigation, spanning 8 benchmark datasets and 3 tasks (question answering, text summarization, and text-to-SQL), highlights the prevalence of the hypothesis under different settings. Among the statements, we highlight the `Sim-Any' hypothesis as the most actionable, and demonstrate how it can be leveraged by proposing data-free black-box UQ methods that aggregate similarities between generations for confidence estimation. These approaches can outperform the closest baselines, showcasing the practical value of the empirically observed consistency hypothesis.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.21803v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) play a vital role in monitoring cardiac health and diagnosing heart diseases. However, traditional deep learning approaches for ECG analysis rely heavily on large-scale manual annotations, which are both time-consuming and resource-intensive to obtain. To overcome this limitation, self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising alternative, enabling the extraction of robust ECG representations that can be efficiently transferred to various downstream tasks. While previous studies have explored SSL for ECG pretraining and multi-modal ECG-language alignment, they often fail to capture the multi-scale nature of ECG signals. As a result, these methods struggle to learn generalized representations due to their inability to model the hierarchical structure of ECG data. To address this gap, we introduce MELP, a novel Multi-scale ECG-Language Pretraining (MELP) model that fully leverages hierarchical supervision from ECG-text pairs. MELP first pretrains a cardiology-specific language model to enhance its understanding of clinical text. It then applies three levels of cross-modal supervision-at the token, beat, and rhythm levels-to align ECG signals with textual reports, capturing structured information across different time scales. We evaluate MELP on three public ECG datasets across multiple tasks, including zero-shot ECG classification, linear probing, and transfer learning. Experimental results demonstrate that MELP outperforms existing SSL methods, underscoring its effectiveness and adaptability across diverse clinical applications.

This paper reports outcomes from the Columbia Convening on AI Openness and Safety (San Francisco, 19 Nov 2024) and its six-week preparatory programme involving more than forty-five researchers, engineers, and policy leaders from academia, industry, civil society, and government. Using a participatory, solutions-oriented process, the working groups produced (i) a research agenda at the intersection of safety and open source AI; (ii) a mapping of existing and needed technical interventions and open source tools to safely and responsibly deploy open foundation models across the AI development workflow; and (iii) a mapping of the content safety filter ecosystem with a proposed roadmap for future research and development. We find that openness -- understood as transparent weights, interoperable tooling, and public governance -- can enhance safety by enabling independent scrutiny, decentralized mitigation, and culturally plural oversight. However, significant gaps persist: scarce multimodal and multilingual benchmarks, limited defenses against prompt-injection and compositional attacks in agentic systems, and insufficient participatory mechanisms for communities most affected by AI harms. The paper concludes with a roadmap of five priority research directions, emphasizing participatory inputs, future-proof content filters, ecosystem-wide safety infrastructure, rigorous agentic safeguards, and expanded harm taxonomies. These recommendations informed the February 2025 French AI Action Summit and lay groundwork for an open, plural, and accountable AI safety discipline.",

    "title": "On the Feasibility of Poisoning Text-to-Image AI Models via Adversarial Mislabeling",
    "description": "arXiv:2506.21874v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Today's text-to-image generative models are trained on millions of images sourced from the Internet, each paired with a detailed caption produced by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). This part of the training pipeline is critical for supplying the models with large volumes of high-quality image-caption pairs during training. However, recent work suggests that VLMs are vulnerable to stealthy adversarial attacks, where adversarial perturbations are added to images to mislead the VLMs into producing incorrect captions. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of adversarial mislabeling attacks on VLMs as a mechanism to poisoning training pipelines for text-to-image models. Our experiments demonstrate that VLMs are highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, allowing attackers to produce benign-looking images that are consistently miscaptioned by the VLM models. This has the effect of injecting strong 'dirty-label' poison samples into the training pipeline for text-to-image models, successfully altering their behavior with a small number of poisoned samples. We find that while potential defenses can be effective, they can be targeted and circumvented by adaptive attackers. This suggests a cat-and-mouse game that is likely to reduce the quality of training data and increase the cost of text-to-image model development. Finally, we demonstrate the real-world effectiveness of these attacks, achieving high attack success (over 73%) even in black-box scenarios against commercial VLMs (Google Vertex AI and Microsoft Azure).",

    "description": "arXiv:2505.11718v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: AI-based peer review systems tend to produce shallow and overpraising suggestions compared to human feedback. Here, we evaluate how well a reasoning LLM trained with multi-objective reinforcement learning (REMOR) can overcome these limitations. We start by designing a multi-aspect reward function that aligns with human evaluation of reviews. The aspects are related to the review itself (e.g., criticisms, novelty) and the relationship between the review and the manuscript (i.e., relevance). First, we perform supervised fine-tuning of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B using LoRA on PeerRT, a new dataset of high-quality top AI conference reviews enriched with reasoning traces. We then apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train two models: REMOR-H (with the human-aligned reward) and REMOR-U (with a uniform reward). Interestingly, the human-aligned reward penalizes aspects typically associated with strong reviews, leading REMOR-U to produce qualitatively more substantive feedback. Our results show that REMOR-U and REMOR-H achieve more than twice the average rewards of human reviews, non-reasoning state-of-the-art agentic multi-modal AI review systems, and general commercial LLM baselines. We found that while the best AI and human reviews are comparable in quality, REMOR avoids the long tail of low-quality human reviews. We discuss how reasoning is key to achieving these improvements and release the Human-aligned Peer Review Reward (HPRR) function, the Peer Review Reasoning-enriched Traces (PeerRT) dataset, and the REMOR models, which we believe can help spur progress in the area.",

Prompt-based models generally offer greater output flexibility but deliver lower accuracy, whereas SFT-based models achieve higher performance yet face a fundamental mismatch: next POI recommendation data does not naturally suit supervised fine-tuning. In SFT, the model is trained to reproduce the exact ground truth, but each training example provides only a single target POI, so there is no ground truth for producing a top-k list. To address this, we propose Refine-POI, a reinforcement fine-tuning framework for next POI recommendation.

    "description": "arXiv:2506.22331v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) is a classic score-based algorithm for causal discovery from observational data. In the sample limit, it recovers the Markov equivalence class of graphs that describe the data. Still, it faces two challenges in practice: computational cost and finite-sample accuracy. In this paper, we develop Less Greedy Equivalence Search (LGES), a variant of GES that retains its theoretical guarantees while partially addressing these limitations. LGES modifies the greedy step: rather than always applying the highest-scoring insertion, it avoids edge insertions between variables for which the score implies some conditional independence. This more targeted search yields up to a (10)-fold speed-up and a substantial reduction in structural error relative to GES. Moreover, LGES can guide the search using prior assumptions, while correcting these assumptions when contradicted by the data. Finally, LGES can exploit interventional data to refine the learned observational equivalence class. We prove that LGES recovers the true equivalence class in the sample limit from observational and interventional data, even with misspecified prior assumptions. Experiments demonstrate that LGES outperforms GES and other baselines in speed, accuracy, and robustness to misspecified assumptions. Our code is available at https://github.com/CausalAILab/lges.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.21583v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Hope is a positive emotional state involving the expectation of favorable future outcomes, while hope speech refers to communication that promotes optimism, resilience, and support, particularly in adverse contexts. Although hope speech detection has gained attention in Natural Language Processing (NLP), existing research mainly focuses on high-resource languages and standardized scripts, often overlooking informal and underrepresented forms such as Roman Urdu. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to address hope speech detection in code-mixed Roman Urdu by introducing a carefully annotated dataset, thereby filling a critical gap in inclusive NLP research for low-resource, informal language varieties. This study makes four key contributions: (1) it introduces the first multi-class annotated dataset for Roman Urdu hope speech, comprising Generalized Hope, Realistic Hope, Unrealistic Hope, and Not Hope categories; (2) it explores the psychological foundations of hope and analyzes its linguistic patterns in code-mixed Roman Urdu to inform dataset development; (3) it proposes a custom attention-based transformer model optimized for the syntactic and semantic variability of Roman Urdu, evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation; and (4) it verifies the statistical significance of performance gains using a t-test. The proposed model, XLM-R, achieves the best performance with a cross-validation score of 0.78, outperforming the baseline SVM (0.75) and BiLSTM (0.76), with gains of 4% and 2.63% respectively.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.21722v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: While diffusion models demonstrate strong generative capabilities in image restoration (IR) tasks, their complex architectures and iterative processes limit their practical application compared to mainstream reconstruction-based general ordinary IR networks. Existing approaches primarily focus on optimizing network architecture and diffusion paths but overlook the integration of the diffusion training paradigm within general ordinary IR frameworks. To address these challenges, this paper elucidates key principles for adapting the diffusion training paradigm to general IR training through systematic analysis of time-step dependencies, network hierarchies, noise-level relationships, and multi-restoration task correlations, proposing a new IR framework supported by diffusion-based training. To enable IR networks to simultaneously restore images and model generative representations, we introduce a series of regularization strategies that align diffusion objectives with IR tasks, improving generalization in single-task scenarios. Furthermore, recognizing that diffusion-based generation exerts varying influences across different IR tasks, we develop an incremental training paradigm and task-specific adaptors, further enhancing performance in multi-task unified IR. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves the generalization of IR networks in single-task IR and achieves superior performance in multi-task unified IR. Notably, the proposed framework can be seamlessly integrated into existing general IR architectures.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.21788v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Graph foundation models using graph neural networks promise sustainable, efficient atomistic modeling. To tackle challenges of processing multi-source, multi-fidelity data during pre-training, recent studies employ multi-task learning, in which shared message passing layers initially process input atomistic structures regardless of source, then route them to multiple decoding heads that predict data-specific outputs. This approach stabilizes pre-training and enhances a model's transferability to unexplored chemical regions. Preliminary results on approximately four million structures are encouraging, yet questions remain about generalizability to larger, more diverse datasets and scalability on supercomputers. We propose a multi-task parallelism method that distributes each head across computing resources with GPU acceleration. Implemented in the open-source HydraGNN architecture, our method was trained on over 24 million structures from five datasets and tested on the Perlmutter, Aurora, and Frontier supercomputers, demonstrating efficient scaling on all three highly heterogeneous super-computing architectures.",

However, timbre information from the source speaker is inherently embedded in the content representations, causing significant timbre leakage and reducing similarity to the target speaker. To address this, we introduce a Universal Semantic Matching (USM) residual block to a content extractor. The residual block consists of two weighted branches: 1) universal semantic dictionary based Content Feature Re-expression (CFR) module, supplying timbre-free content representation. 2) skip connection to the original content layer, providing complementary fine-grained information. In the CFR module, each dictionary entry in the universal semantic dictionary represents a phoneme class, computed statistically using speech from multiple speakers, creating a stable, speaker-independent semantic set. We introduce a CFR method to obtain timbre-free content representations by expressing each content frame as a weighted linear combination of dictionary entries using corresponding phoneme posteriors as weights. Extensive experiments across various VC frameworks demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates timbre leakage and significantly improves similarity to the target speaker.",

    "description": "arXiv:2501.14275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their ability to solve Olympiad-level math problems. However, the training and evaluation of these models are constrained by the limited size and quality of available datasets, as creating large-scale data for such advanced problems requires extensive effort from human experts. In addition, current benchmarks are prone to contamination, leading to unreliable evaluations. In this paper, we present an automated pipeline that leverages the rich resources of the Art of Problem Solving (AoPS) forum, which predominantly features Olympiad-level problems and community-driven solutions. Using open-source LLMs, we develop a method to extract question-answer pairs from the forum, resulting in AoPS-Instruct, a dataset of more than 600,000 high-quality QA pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning LLMs on AoPS-Instruct improves their reasoning abilities across various benchmarks. Moreover, we build an automatic pipeline that introduces LiveAoPSBench, an evolving evaluation set with timestamps, derived from the latest forum data, providing a contamination-resistant benchmark for assessing LLM performance. Notably, we observe a significant decline in LLM performance over time, suggesting their success on older examples may stem from pre-training exposure rather than true reasoning ability. Our work presents a scalable approach to creating and maintaining large-scale, high-quality datasets for advanced math reasoning, offering valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in this domain.

Beyond their classical use as chatbots, these systems are increasingly used for complex analysis and problem-solving in specialized fields, including bioinformatics. First, we introduce BIOPARS-BENCH, a dataset from over 10,000 scientific articles, textbooks, and medical websites. BioParsQA was also introduced to evaluate the proposed model, which consists of 5,231 Persian medical questions and answers. This study then introduces BioPars, a simple but accurate measure designed to assess LLMs for three main abilities: acquiring subject-specific knowledge, interpreting and synthesizing such knowledge, and demonstrating proper evidence. Comparing ChatGPT, Llama, and Galactica, our study highlights their ability to remember and retrieve learned knowledge but also reveals shortcomings in addressing higher-level, real-world questions and fine-grained inferences. These findings indicate the need for further fine-tuning to address the capabilities of LLM in bioinformatics tasks. To our knowledge, BioPars is the first application of LLM in Persian medical QA, especially for generating long answers. Evaluation of four selected medical QA datasets shows that BioPars has achieved remarkable results compared to comparative approaches. The model on BioParsQA achieved a ROUGE-L score of 29.99, which is an improvement over GPT-4 1.0. The model achieved a BERTScore of 90.87 with the MMR method. The MoverScore and BLEURT values were also higher in this model than the other three models. In addition, the reported scores for the model are MoverScore=60.43 and BLEURT=50.78.

In this paper, we focus on sparsity-based PEFT (SPEFT), which introduces trainable sparse adaptations to the weight matrices in the model, offering greater flexibility in selecting fine-tuned parameters compared to low-rank methods. We conduct the first systematic evaluation of salience metrics for SPEFT, inspired by zero-cost NAS proxies, and identify simple gradient-based metrics is reliable, and results are on par with the best alternatives, offering both computational efficiency and robust performance. Additionally, we compare static and dynamic masking strategies, finding that static masking, which predetermines non-zero entries before training, delivers efficiency without sacrificing performance, while dynamic masking offers no substantial benefits. Across NLP tasks, a simple gradient-based, static SPEFT consistently outperforms other fine-tuning methods for LLMs, providing a simple yet effective baseline for SPEFT. Our work challenges the notion that complexity is necessary for effective PEFT, while our open-source framework establishes a reproducible benchmark for future research, which is available at [https://github.com/0-ml/speft].",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.21573v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Optimizing instructions for large language models (LLMs) is critical for harnessing their full potential in complex and diverse tasks. However, relying solely on white-box approaches demands extensive computational resources and offers limited representational capacity, while black-box models can incur prohibitive financial costs. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework that seamlessly merges the strengths of both paradigms. Black-box models provide high-quality, diverse instruction initializations, and white-box models supply fine-grained interpretability through hidden states and output features. By enforcing a semantic similarity constraint, these components fuse into a unified high-dimensional representation that captures deep semantic and structural nuances, enabling an iterative optimization process to refine instruction quality and adaptability. Extensive evaluations across a broad spectrum of tasks-ranging from complex reasoning to cross-lingual generalization-demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. This fusion of black-box initialization with advanced semantic refinement yields a scalable and efficient solution, paving the way for next-generation LLM-driven applications in diverse real-world scenarios. The source code will be released soon.",

However, existing research centers on offline reinforcement learning training or online optimization using action-level rewards, which limits the agent's dynamic interaction with the environment. This often results in agents settling into local optima, thereby weakening their ability for exploration and error action correction. To address these challenges, we introduce an approach called Mobile-R1, which employs interactive multi-turn reinforcement learning with task-level rewards for mobile agents. Our training framework consists of three stages: initial format finetuning, single-step online training via action-level reward, followed by online training via task-level reward based on multi-turn trajectories. This strategy is designed to enhance the exploration and error correction capabilities of Mobile-R1, leading to significant performance improvements. Moreover, we have collected a dataset covering 28 Chinese applications with 24,521 high-quality manual annotations and established a new benchmark with 500 trajectories.

    "description": "arXiv:2506.21887v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: High-stakes decision-making involves navigating multiple competing objectives with expensive evaluations. For instance, in brachytherapy, clinicians must balance maximizing tumor coverage (e.g., an aspirational target or soft bound of >95% coverage) against strict organ dose limits (e.g., a non-negotiable hard bound of <601 cGy to the bladder), with each plan evaluation being resource-intensive. Selecting Pareto-optimal solutions that match implicit preferences is challenging, as exhaustive Pareto frontier exploration is computationally and cognitively prohibitive, necessitating interactive frameworks to guide users. While decision-makers (DMs) often possess domain knowledge to narrow the search via such soft-hard bounds, current methods often lack systematic approaches to iteratively refine these multi-faceted preference structures. Critically, DMs must trust their final decision, confident they haven't missed superior alternatives; this trust is paramount in high-consequence scenarios. We present Active-MoSH, an interactive local-global framework designed for this process. Its local component integrates soft-hard bounds with probabilistic preference learning, maintaining distributions over DM preferences and bounds for adaptive Pareto subset refinement. This is guided by an active sampling strategy optimizing exploration-exploitation while minimizing cognitive burden. To build DM trust, Active-MoSH's global component, T-MoSH, leverages multi-objective sensitivity analysis to identify potentially overlooked, high-value points beyond immediate feedback. We demonstrate Active-MoSH's performance benefits through diverse synthetic and real-world applications. A user study on AI-generated image selection further validates our hypotheses regarding the framework's ability to improve convergence, enhance DM trust, and provide expressive preference articulation, enabling more effective DMs.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.21796v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Neural network-based compression and decompression of channel state feedback has been one of the most widely studied applications of machine learning (ML) in wireless networks. Various simulation-based studies have shown that ML-based feedback compression can result in reduced overhead and more accurate channel information. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no real-life proofs of concepts demonstrating the benefits of ML-based channel feedback compression in a practical setting, where the user equipment (UE) and base station have no access to each others' ML models. In this paper, we present a novel approach for training interoperable compression and decompression ML models in a confidential manner, and demonstrate the accuracy of the ensuing models using prototype UEs and base stations. The performance of the ML-based channel feedback is measured both in terms of the accuracy of the reconstructed channel information and achieved downlink throughput gains when using the channel information for beamforming. The reported measurement results demonstrate that it is possible to develop an accurate ML-based channel feedback link without having to share ML models between device and network vendors. These results pave the way for a practical implementation of ML-based channel feedback in commercial 6G networks.",

Large language models (LLMs) have become a popular paradigm for sentiment analysis, leveraging multi-task learning to address specific tasks concurrently. However, LLMs with fine-tuning for sentiment analysis often underperforms due to the inherent challenges in managing diverse task complexities. Moreover, constant-weight approaches in multi-task learning struggle to adapt to variations in data characteristics, further complicating model effectiveness. To address these issues, we propose a novel multi-task learning framework with a dynamic adaptive optimization (DAO) module. This module is designed as a plug-and-play component that can be seamlessly integrated into existing models, providing an effective and flexible solution for multi-task learning. The key component of the DAO module is dynamic adaptive loss, which dynamically adjusts the weights assigned to different tasks based on their relative importance and data characteristics during training. Sentiment analyses on a standard and customized financial text dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior performance.

    "description": "arXiv:2406.19680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: In recent years, generative artificial intelligence has achieved significant advancements in the field of image generation, spawning a variety of applications. However, video generation still faces considerable challenges in various aspects, such as controllability, video length, and richness of details, which hinder the application and popularization of this technology. In this work, we propose a controllable video generation framework, dubbed MimicMotion, which can generate high-quality videos of arbitrary length mimicking specific motion guidance. Compared with previous methods, our approach has several highlights. Firstly, we introduce confidence-aware pose guidance that ensures high frame quality and temporal smoothness. Secondly, we introduce regional loss amplification based on pose confidence, which significantly reduces image distortion. Lastly, for generating long and smooth videos, we propose a progressive latent fusion strategy. By this means, we can produce videos of arbitrary length with acceptable resource consumption. With extensive experiments and user studies, MimicMotion demonstrates significant improvements over previous approaches in various aspects.

    "description": "arXiv:2506.22427v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: We propose CLoVE (Clustering of Loss Vector Embeddings), a novel algorithm for Clustered Federated Learning (CFL). In CFL, clients are naturally grouped into clusters based on their data distribution. However, identifying these clusters is challenging, as client assignments are unknown. CLoVE utilizes client embeddings derived from model losses on client data, and leverages the insight that clients in the same cluster share similar loss values, while those in different clusters exhibit distinct loss patterns. Based on these embeddings, CLoVE is able to iteratively identify and separate clients from different clusters and optimize cluster-specific models through federated aggregation. Key advantages of CLoVE over existing CFL algorithms are (1) its simplicity, (2) its applicability to both supervised and unsupervised settings, and (3) the fact that it eliminates the need for near-optimal model initialization, which makes it more robust and better suited for real-world applications. We establish theoretical convergence bounds, showing that CLoVE can recover clusters accurately with high probability in a single round and converges exponentially fast to optimal models in a linear setting. Our comprehensive experiments comparing with a variety of both CFL and generic Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) algorithms on different types of datasets and an extensive array of non-IID settings demonstrate that CLoVE achieves highly accurate cluster recovery in just a few rounds of training, along with state-of-the-art model accuracy, across a variety of both supervised and unsupervised PFL tasks.",

When the number of entities is larger than the model's embedding dimension, which in practical scenarios is often by several orders of magnitude, we have a linear output layer with a rank bottleneck. Such bottlenecked layers limit model expressivity. We investigate both theoretically and empirically how rank bottlenecks affect KGC models. We find that, by limiting the set of feasible predictions, rank bottlenecks hurt ranking accuracy and the distribution fidelity of scores. Inspired by the language modelling literature, we propose KGE-MoS, a mixture-based output layer to break rank bottlenecks in many KGC models.

    "description": "arXiv:2502.04413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a well-suited technique for retrieving privacy-sensitive Electronic Health Records (EHR). It can serve as a key module of the healthcare copilot, helping reduce misdiagnosis for healthcare practitioners and patients. However, the diagnostic accuracy and specificity of existing heuristic-based RAG models used in the medical domain are inadequate, particularly for diseases with similar manifestations. This paper proposes MedRAG, a RAG model enhanced by knowledge graph (KG)-elicited reasoning for the medical domain that retrieves diagnosis and treatment recommendations based on manifestations. MedRAG systematically constructs a comprehensive four-tier hierarchical diagnostic KG encompassing critical diagnostic differences of various diseases. These differences are dynamically integrated with similar EHRs retrieved from an EHR database, and reasoned within a large language model. This process enables more accurate and specific decision support, while also proactively providing follow-up questions to enhance personalized medical decision-making. MedRAG is evaluated on both a public dataset DDXPlus and a private chronic pain diagnostic dataset (CPDD) collected from Tan Tock Seng Hospital, and its performance is compared against various existing RAG methods. Experimental results show that, leveraging the information integration and relational abilities of the KG, our MedRAG provides more specific diagnostic insights and outperforms state-of-the-art models in reducing misdiagnosis rates.

    "title": "DeepTalk: Towards Seamless and Smart Speech Interaction with Adaptive Modality-Specific MoE",
    "description": "arXiv:2506.21864v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Native multimodal large language models (MLLMs) restructure a single large language model (LLM) into a spoken language model (SLM) capable of both speech and text generation. Compared to modular and aligned MLLMs, native MLLMs preserve richer paralinguistic features such as emotion and prosody, and generate speech responses directly within the backbone LLM rather than using a separate speech decoder. This integration also results in lower response latency and smoother interaction. However, native MLLMs suffer from catastrophic forgetting and performance degradation because the available paired speech-text data is insufficient to support the pretraining of MLLMs compared to the vast amount of text data required to pretrain text LLMs. To address this issue, we propose DeepTalk, a framework for adaptive modality expert learning based on a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. DeepTalk first adaptively distinguishes modality experts according to their modality load within the LLM. Each modality expert then undergoes specialized single-modality training, followed by joint multimodal collaborative training. As a result, DeepTalk incurs only a 5.5% performance drop compared to the original LLM, which is significantly lower than the average performance drop of over 20% typically seen in native MLLMs (such as GLM-4-Voice), and is on par with modular MLLMs. Meanwhile, the end-to-end dialogue latency remains within 0.5 seconds, ensuring a seamless and intelligent speech interaction experience.

    "summary": "arXiv:2506.21864v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Native multimodal large language models (MLLMs) restructure a single large language model (LLM) into a spoken language model (SLM) capable of both speech and text generation. Compared to modular and aligned MLLMs, native MLLMs preserve richer paralinguistic features such as emotion and prosody, and generate speech responses directly within the backbone LLM rather than using a separate speech decoder. This integration also results in lower response latency and smoother interaction. However, native MLLMs suffer from catastrophic forgetting and performance degradation because the available paired speech-text data is insufficient to support the pretraining of MLLMs compared to the vast amount of text data required to pretrain text LLMs. To address this issue, we propose DeepTalk, a framework for adaptive modality expert learning based on a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. DeepTalk first adaptively distinguishes modality experts according to their modality load within the LLM. Each modality expert then undergoes specialized single-modality training, followed by joint multimodal collaborative training. As a result, DeepTalk incurs only a 5.5% performance drop compared to the original LLM, which is significantly lower than the average performance drop of over 20% typically seen in native MLLMs (such as GLM-4-Voice), and is on par with modular MLLMs. Meanwhile, the end-to-end dialogue latency remains within 0.5 seconds, ensuring a seamless and intelligent speech interaction experience.

However, conventional federated learning (FL) algorithms typically consider unimodal datasets, require identical model architectures, and fail to leverage the rich information embedded in multimodal data, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios with diverse modalities and varying client capabilities. To address this issue, we propose Sheaf-DMFL, a novel decentralized multimodal learning framework leveraging sheaf theory to enhance collaboration among devices with diverse modalities. Specifically, each client has a set of local feature encoders for its different modalities, whose outputs are concatenated before passing through a task-specific layer. While encoders for the same modality are trained collaboratively across clients, we capture the intrinsic correlations among clients' task-specific layers using a sheaf-based structure. To further enhance learning capability, we propose an enhanced algorithm named Sheaf-DMFL-Att, which tailors the attention mechanism within each client to capture correlations among different modalities. A rigorous convergence analysis of Sheaf-DMFL-Att is provided, establishing its theoretical guarantees. Extensive simulations are conducted on real-world link blockage prediction and mmWave beamforming scenarios, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms in such heterogeneous wireless communication systems.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.22291v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Generating realistic 3D indoor scenes from user inputs remains a challenging problem in computer vision and graphics, requiring careful balance of geometric consistency, spatial relationships, and visual realism. While neural generation methods often produce repetitive elements due to limited global spatial reasoning, procedural approaches can leverage constraints for controllable generation but struggle with multi-constraint scenarios. When constraints become numerous, object collisions frequently occur, forcing the removal of furniture items and compromising layout completeness. To address these limitations, we propose RoomCraft, a multi-stage pipeline that converts real images, sketches, or text descriptions into coherent 3D indoor scenes. Our approach combines a scene generation pipeline with a constraint-driven optimization framework. The pipeline first extracts high-level scene information from user inputs and organizes it into a structured format containing room type, furniture items, and spatial relations. It then constructs a spatial relationship network to represent furniture arrangements and generates an optimized placement sequence using a heuristic-based depth-first search (HDFS) algorithm to ensure layout coherence. To handle complex multi-constraint scenarios, we introduce a unified constraint representation that processes both formal specifications and natural language inputs, enabling flexible constraint-oriented adjustments through a comprehensive action space design. Additionally, we propose a Conflict-Aware Positioning Strategy (CAPS) that dynamically adjusts placement weights to minimize furniture collisions and ensure layout completeness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoomCraft significantly outperforms existing methods in generating realistic, semantically coherent, and visually appealing room layouts across diverse input modalities.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.21571v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), which autonomously produce a reasoning Chain of Thought (CoT) before producing final responses, offer a promising approach to interpreting and monitoring model behaviors. Inspired by the observation that certain CoT patterns -- e.g., ``Wait, did I miss anything?'' -- consistently emerge across tasks, we explore whether LRMs exhibit human-like cognitive habits. Building on Habits of Mind, a well-established framework of cognitive habits associated with successful human problem-solving, we introduce CogTest, a principled benchmark designed to evaluate LRMs' cognitive habits. CogTest includes 16 cognitive habits, each instantiated with 25 diverse tasks, and employs an evidence-first extraction method to ensure reliable habit identification. With CogTest, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 16 widely used LLMs (13 LRMs and 3 non-reasoning ones). Our findings reveal that LRMs, unlike conventional LLMs, not only exhibit human-like habits but also adaptively deploy them according to different tasks. Finer-grained analyses further uncover patterns of similarity and difference in LRMs' cognitive habit profiles, particularly certain inter-family similarity (e.g., Qwen-3 models and DeepSeek-R1). Extending the study to safety-related tasks, we observe that certain habits, such as Taking Responsible Risks, are strongly associated with the generation of harmful responses. These findings suggest that studying persistent behavioral patterns in LRMs' CoTs is a valuable step toward deeper understanding of LLM misbehavior.

These findings suggest that studying persistent behavioral patterns in LRMs' CoTs is a valuable step toward deeper understanding of LLM misbehavior.

    "description": "arXiv:2506.22396v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Inference accounts for the majority of latency and energy consumption in large language model (LLM) deployments, often exceeding 90% of total cost. While training-time efficiency has seen extensive progress, runtime optimization remains a key bottleneck, particularly under autoregressive decoding. Existing approaches -- such as pruning, quantization, early exits, and speculative decoding -- often require retraining, architectural changes, or disrupt decoding compatibility. We introduce QuickSilver, a modular, token-level framework that enables semantic adaptivity at inference time without altering model weights or structure. QuickSilver integrates four synergistic mechanisms: (i) Dynamic Token Halting, which halts computation for tokens with converged representations; (ii) KV Cache Skipping, which selectively suppresses memory writes to reduce attention overhead; and (iii) Contextual Token Fusion, which collapses redundant tokens into shared paths to shrink sequence length. Unlike speculative decoding or MoE routing, QuickSilver operates entirely on frozen, dense models and requires no auxiliary networks. Applied to GPT-2 and Llama-2 across WikiText-103 and C4, QuickSilver achieves up to 39.6% FLOP reduction with negligible perplexity degradation (<=0.2).",

Recently, AI-based tutoring systems have emerged to assist teachers; however, these systems require high-quality and large-scale teacher feedback data, which is both time-consuming and costly to generate manually. In this study, we propose FEAT, a cost-effective framework for generating teacher feedback, and have constructed three complementary datasets: (1) DIRECT-Manual (DM), where both humans and large language models (LLMs) collaboratively generate high-quality teacher feedback, albeit at a higher cost; (2) DIRECT-Generated (DG), an LLM-only generated, cost-effective dataset with lower quality;, and (3) DIRECT-Augmented (DA), primarily based on DG with a small portion of DM added to enhance quality while maintaining cost-efficiency.

However, the multigraph setting, where multiple paths with distinct attributes can exist between destinations, has largely been overlooked, despite its high practical relevancy. In this paper, we introduce two neural approaches to address multi-objective routing on multigraphs. Our first approach works directly on the multigraph, by autoregressively selecting edges until a tour is completed. On the other hand, our second model first prunes the multigraph into a simple graph and then builds routes. We validate both models experimentally and find that they demonstrate strong performance across a variety of problems, including the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).",

Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in this field due to the rapid development of deep neural networks.

In addition, RL's limited ability to generalize across tasks restricts its applicability in dynamic and real-world environments. With the arisen of Continual Learning (CL), Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL) has emerged as a promising research direction to address these limitations by enabling agents to learn continuously, adapt to new tasks, and retain previously acquired knowledge. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive examination of CRL, focusing on its core concepts, challenges, and methodologies. Firstly, we conduct a detailed review of existing works, organizing and analyzing their metrics, tasks, benchmarks, and scenario settings. Secondly, we propose a new taxonomy of CRL methods, categorizing them into four types from the perspective of knowledge storage and/or transfer. Finally, our analysis highlights the unique challenges of CRL and provides practical insights into future directions.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.21819v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Scientific publications, primarily digitized as PDFs, remain static and unstructured, limiting the accessibility and reusability of the contained knowledge. At best, scientific knowledge from publications is provided in tabular formats, which lack semantic context. A more flexible, structured, and semantic representation is needed to make scientific knowledge understandable and processable by both humans and machines. We propose an evolution model of knowledge representation, inspired by the 5-star Linked Open Data (LOD) model, with five stages and defined criteria to guide the stepwise transition from a digital artifact, such as a PDF, to a semantic representation integrated in a knowledge graph (KG). Based on an exemplary workflow implementing the entire model, we developed a hybrid approach, called SciMantify, leveraging tabular formats of scientific knowledge, e.g., results from secondary studies, to support its evolving semantification. In the approach, humans and machines collaborate closely by performing semantic annotation tasks (SATs) and refining the results to progressively improve the semantic representation of scientific knowledge. We implemented the approach in the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG), an established platform for improving the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of scientific knowledge. A preliminary user experiment showed that the approach simplifies the preprocessing of scientific knowledge, reduces the effort for the evolving semantification, and enhances the knowledge representation through better alignment with the KG structures.",

The research employs advanced text mining techniques, including sentiment analysis using the RoBERTa-Large model and topic modeling with LDA. Empirical findings underscore the significant advantage of incorporating textual data, with the PSO-LSTM model outperforming benchmark models such as SVM, SVR, ARIMA, and GARCH. Ablation experiments reveal the contribution of each textual data category to the overall forecasting performance.

    "title": "IndexTTS2: A Breakthrough in Emotionally Expressive and Duration-Controlled Auto-Regressive Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech",
    "description": "arXiv:2506.21619v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Large-scale text-to-speech (TTS) models are typically categorized into autoregressive and non-autoregressive systems. Although autoregressive systems exhibit certain advantages in speech naturalness, their token-by-token generation mechanism makes it difficult to precisely control the duration of synthesized speech. This is a key limitation in applications such as video dubbing that require strict audio-visual synchronization. This paper introduces IndexTTS2, which proposes a novel and autoregressive-model-friendly method for speech duration control. The method supports two generation modes: one allows explicit specification of the number of generated tokens for precise duration control; the other does not require manual input and lets the model freely generate speech while preserving prosodic characteristics from the input prompt. Furthermore, IndexTTS2 achieves disentanglement between emotional expression and speaker identity, enabling independent control of timbre and emotion. In the zero-shot setting, the model can perfectly reproduce the emotional characteristics of the input prompt. Users may also provide a separate emotion prompt, even from a different speaker, allowing the model to reconstruct the target timbre while conveying the desired emotion. To enhance clarity during strong emotional expressions, we incorporate GPT latent representations to improve speech stability. Meanwhile, to lower the barrier for emotion control, we design a soft instruction mechanism based on textual descriptions by fine-tuning Qwen3. This enables effective guidance of speech generation with desired emotional tendencies using natural language input. Experimental results demonstrate that IndexTTS2 outperforms existing state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS models in word error rate, speaker similarity, and emotional fidelity.",

Forecasting requires a large amount of research on the internet, and evaluations require time for events to happen, making the development of forecasting benchmarks challenging. To date, no forecasting benchmark provides a realistic, hermetic, and repeatable environment for LLM forecasters. We introduce Bench To the Future (BTF), a 'pastcasting' benchmark with hundreds of high-quality questions for which the resolution is already known. Each question is accompanied by a large offline corpus of tens of thousands of relevant web pages, enabling a way to elicit realistic 'forecasts' on past events from LLMs. Results suggest that our pastcasting environment can produce results comparable to those based on forecasts using the internet on at-the-time unresolved questions. We show results benchmarking agent and chain-of-thought forecasting approaches using several LLMs, including the recently-released Claude 4 models, and demonstrate BTF's ability to track steady forecasting capability progress over time. We intend this to be a living benchmark, with new questions added continually to account for increasing training data cutoff dates. We invite researchers to contact us at hello@futuresearch.ai to utilize our benchmark or tooling for their own research.",

In this work, we present the first evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on the textbook question answering (TQA) task using the CK12-QA dataset. We assess the performance of recent vision-language models, including LLaVA and LLaMA 3.2-Vision, across various input configurations. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that integrates both paragraphs and diagrams from the lesson into the prompt.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce Crab, the first agent benchmark framework designed to support cross-environment tasks, incorporating a graph-based fine-grained evaluation method and an efficient mechanism for task and evaluator construction. Our framework supports multiple devices and can be easily extended to any environment with a Python interface. Leveraging Crab, we developed a cross-platform Crab Benchmark-v0 comprising 120 tasks in computer desktop and mobile phone environments. We evaluated four advanced MLMs using different single and multi-agent system configurations on this benchmark.

    "description": "arXiv:2506.21873v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in visual grounding, establishing themselves as a general interface for various vision-language applications. This progress has driven the development of token pruning methods to mitigate the high computational costs associated with processing numerous visual tokens. However, we observe that pruning significantly weakens the model's grounding ability, leading to incorrect predictions and drastic performance degradation. In Referring Expression Comprehension (REC), for instance, pruning causes the accuracy of LLaVA on the RefCOCO validation set to drop from 56.14% to 15.34%. Our analysis identifies misaligned position IDs after pruning as the primary cause of this degradation, as both the order and value of these IDs are crucial for maintaining performance in grounding tasks. To address this issue, we propose Grounding-Aware Token Pruning (GAP), a simple yet effective adjustment to position IDs that recovers REC accuracy back to 51.42%, which is 90% of the original performance in the without pruning setting, all while requiring no additional training, memory, or computational overhead. Applied to models such as Shikra, MiniGPTv2, and the LLaVA series, our method consistently improves performance across various token pruning strategies.",

Our main contribution is a novel evaluation methodology that enhances the interpretability of LLM assessment. For each task type, we define a set of detailed criteria and develop a scoring protocol where models evaluate responses and provide justifications for their ratings. This enables transparent, criteria-driven evaluation beyond traditional resource-consuming, side-by-side human comparisons. POLLUX includes a detailed, fine-grained taxonomy of 35 task types covering diverse generative domains such as code generation, creative writing, and practical assistant use cases, totaling 2,100 manually crafted and professionally authored prompts. Each task is categorized by difficulty (easy/medium/hard), with experts constructing the dataset entirely from scratch. We also release a family of LLM-as-a-Judge (7B and 32B) evaluators trained for nuanced assessment of generative outputs. This approach provides scalable, interpretable evaluation and annotation tools for model development, effectively replacing costly and less precise human judgments.",

To provide a more holistic and realistic assessment, we introduce HealthQA-BR, the first large-scale, system-wide benchmark for Portuguese-speaking healthcare. Comprising 5,632 questions from Brazil's national licensing and residency exams, it uniquely assesses knowledge not only in medicine and its specialties but also in nursing, dentistry, psychology, social work, and other allied health professions. We conducted a rigorous zero-shot evaluation of over 20 leading LLMs. Our results reveal that while state-of-the-art models like GPT 4.1 achieve high overall accuracy (86.6%), this top-line score masks alarming, previously unmeasured deficiencies. A granular analysis shows performance plummets from near-perfect in specialties like Ophthalmology (98.7%) to barely passing in Neurosurgery (60.0%) and, most notably, Social Work (68.4%). This 'spiky' knowledge profile is a systemic issue observed across all models, demonstrating that high-level scores are insufficient for safety validation. By publicly releasing HealthQA-BR and our evaluation suite, we provide a crucial tool to move beyond single-score evaluations and toward a more honest, granular audit of AI readiness for the entire healthcare team.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.21612v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Currently, considerable strides have been achieved in Point-of-Interest (POI) embedding methodologies, driven by the emergence of novel POI tasks like recommendation and classification. Despite the success of task-specific, end-to-end models in POI embedding, several challenges remain. These include the need for more effective multi-context sampling strategies, insufficient exploration of multiple POI contexts, limited versatility, and inadequate generalization. To address these issues, we propose the AdaptGOT model, which integrates both the (Adapt)ive representation learning technique and the Geographical-Co-Occurrence-Text (GOT) representation with a particular emphasis on Geographical location, Co-Occurrence and Textual information. The AdaptGOT model comprises three key components: (1) contextual neighborhood generation, which integrates advanced mixed sampling techniques such as KNN, density-based, importance-based, and category-aware strategies to capture complex contextual neighborhoods; (2) an advanced GOT representation enhanced by an attention mechanism, designed to derive high-quality, customized representations and efficiently capture complex interrelations between POIs; and (3) the MoE-based adaptive encoder-decoder architecture, which ensures topological consistency and enriches contextual representation by minimizing Jensen-Shannon divergence across varying contexts. Experiments on two real-world datasets and multiple POI tasks substantiate the superior performance of the proposed AdaptGOT model.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.21892v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: As point cloud data increases in prevalence in a variety of applications, the ability to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) point cloud objects becomes critical for ensuring model safety and reliability. However, this problem remains under-explored in existing research. Inspired by success in the image domain, we propose to exploit advances in 3D vision-language models (3D VLMs) for OOD detection in point cloud objects. However, a major challenge is that point cloud datasets used to pre-train 3D VLMs are drastically smaller in size and object diversity than their image-based counterparts. Critically, they often contain exclusively computer-designed synthetic objects. This leads to a substantial domain shift when the model is transferred to practical tasks involving real objects scanned from the physical environment. In this paper, our empirical experiments show that synthetic-to-real domain shift significantly degrades the alignment of point cloud with their associated text embeddings in the 3D VLM latent space, hindering downstream performance. To address this, we propose a novel methodology called SODA which improves the detection of OOD point clouds through a neighborhood-based score propagation scheme. SODA is inference-based, requires no additional model training, and achieves state-of-the-art performance over existing approaches across datasets and problem settings.",

    "description": "arXiv:2503.02703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Graphical assets play an important role in the design and development of games. There is potential in the use of AI-driven generative tools, to aid in creating graphical assets, thus improving game design and development pipelines. However, there is little research to address how the generative methods can fit into the wider pipeline. There also no guidelines or heuristics for creating such tools. To address this gap we conducted a user study with 16 game designers and developers to examine their behaviour and interaction with generative tools for graphical assets. The findings highlight that early design stage is preferred by all participants. Designers and developers are inclined to use such tools for creating large amounts of variations at the cost of quality as they can improve the quality of the artefacts once they generate a suitable asset. The results also strongly raised the need for better integration of such tools in existing design and development environments and the need for the outputs to be in common data formats, to be manipulatable and smoothly integrate into existing environments. The study also highlights the requirement for further emphasis on the needs of the users to incorporate these tools effectively in existing pipelines. Informed by these results, we provide a set of heuristics for creating tools that meet the expectations and needs of game designers and developers.",

    "description": "arXiv:2109.05721v2 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The recent progress of CNN has dramatically improved face alignment performance. However, few works have paid attention to the error-bias with respect to error distribution of facial landmarks. In this paper, we investigate the error-bias issue in face alignment, where the distributions of landmark errors tend to spread along the tangent line to landmark curves. This error-bias is not trivial since it is closely connected to the ambiguous landmark labeling task. Inspired by this observation, we seek a way to leverage the error-bias property for better convergence of CNN model. To this end, we propose anisotropic direction loss (ADL) and anisotropic attention module (AAM) for coordinate and heatmap regression, respectively. ADL imposes strong binding force in normal direction for each landmark point on facial boundaries. On the other hand, AAM is an attention module which can get anisotropic attention mask focusing on the region of point and its local edge connected by adjacent points, it has a stronger response in tangent than in normal, which means relaxed constraints in the tangent. These two methods work in a complementary manner to learn both facial structures and texture details. Finally, we integrate them into an optimized end-to-end training pipeline named ADNet. Our ADNet achieves state-of-the-art results on 300W, WFLW and COFW datasets, which demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness.",

In this work, we propose a novel framework that leverages a multi-objective, contextual sequential sampling strategy. Item selection is guided by Bayesian updates that dynamically adjust scores to optimize diversity. The reward formulation integrates multiple diversity metrics-including the log-determinant volume of a tuned similarity submatrix and ridge leverage scores-along with a diversity gain uncertainty term to address the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Both intra- and inter-batch diversity are modeled to promote serendipity and minimize redundancy. A dominance-based ranking procedure identifies Pareto-optimal item sets, enabling adaptive and balanced selections at each iteration. Experiments on a real-world dataset show that our approach significantly improves diversity without sacrificing relevance, demonstrating its potential to enhance user experience in large-scale recommendation settings.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.21602v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have raised urgent concerns about LLM-generated text authenticity, prompting regulatory demands for reliable identification mechanisms. Although watermarking offers a promising solution, existing approaches struggle to simultaneously achieve three critical requirements: text quality preservation, model-agnostic detection, and message embedding capacity, which are crucial for practical implementation. To achieve these goals, the key challenge lies in balancing the trade-off between text quality preservation and message embedding capacity. To address this challenge, we propose BiMark, a novel watermarking framework that achieves these requirements through three key innovations: (1) a bit-flip unbiased reweighting mechanism enabling model-agnostic detection, (2) a multilayer architecture enhancing detectability without compromising generation quality, and (3) an information encoding approach supporting multi-bit watermarking. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we validate that, compared to state-of-the-art multi-bit watermarking methods, BiMark achieves up to 30% higher extraction rates for short texts while maintaining text quality indicated by lower perplexity, and performs comparably to non-watermarked text on downstream tasks such as summarization and translation.",

Traditional sequential recommenders predominantly rely on ID-based embeddings, which capture CF signals through high-order co-occurrence patterns. However, these embeddings depend solely on past interactions, lacking transferable knowledge to generalize to unseen domains. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have motivated text-based recommendation approaches that derive item representations from textual descriptions. While these methods enhance generalization, they fail to encode CF signals-i.e., latent item correlations and preference patterns-crucial for effective recommendation. We argue that an ideal embedding model should seamlessly integrate CF signals with rich semantic representations to improve both in-domain and out-of-domain recommendation performance. To this end, we propose LLM2Rec, a novel embedding model tailored for sequential recommendation, integrating the rich semantic understanding of LLMs with CF awareness. Our approach follows a two-stage training framework: (1) Collaborative Supervised Fine-tuning, which adapts LLMs to infer item relationships based on historical interactions, and (2) Item-level Embedding Modeling, which refines these specialized LLMs into structured item embedding models that encode both semantic and collaborative information. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that LLM2Rec effectively improves recommendation quality across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging LLMs to build more robust, generalizable embedding models for sequential recommendation. Our codes are available at https://github.com/HappyPointer/LLM2Rec.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.22338v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Building damage identification shortly after a disaster is crucial for guiding emergency response and recovery efforts. Although optical satellite imagery is commonly used for disaster mapping, its effectiveness is often hampered by cloud cover or the absence of pre-event acquisitions. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel multimodal deep learning (DL) framework for detecting building damage using single-date very high resolution (VHR) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery from the Italian Space Agency (ASI) COSMO SkyMed (CSK) constellation, complemented by auxiliary geospatial data. Our method integrates SAR image patches, OpenStreetMap (OSM) building footprints, digital surface model (DSM) data, and structural and exposure attributes from the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) to improve detection accuracy and contextual interpretation. Unlike existing approaches that depend on pre and post event imagery, our model utilizes only post event data, facilitating rapid deployment in critical scenarios. The framework effectiveness is demonstrated using a new dataset from the 2023 earthquake in Turkey, covering multiple cities with diverse urban settings. Results highlight that incorporating geospatial features significantly enhances detection performance and generalizability to previously unseen areas. By combining SAR imagery with detailed vulnerability and exposure information, our approach provides reliable and rapid building damage assessments without the dependency from available pre-event data. Moreover, the automated and scalable data generation process ensures the framework's applicability across diverse disaster-affected regions, underscoring its potential to support effective disaster management and recovery efforts. Code and data will be made available upon acceptance of the paper.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.21627v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Developing a general robot manipulation system capable of performing a wide range of tasks in complex, dynamic, and unstructured real-world environments has long been a challenging task. It is widely recognized that achieving human-like efficiency and robustness manipulation requires the robotic brain to integrate a comprehensive set of functions, such as task planning, policy generation, anomaly monitoring and handling, and long-term memory, achieving high-efficiency operation across all functions. Vision-Language Models (VLMs), pretrained on massive multimodal data, have acquired rich world knowledge, exhibiting exceptional scene understanding and multimodal reasoning capabilities. However, existing methods typically focus on realizing only a single function or a subset of functions within the robotic brain, without integrating them into a unified cognitive architecture. Inspired by a divide-and-conquer strategy and the architecture of the human brain, we propose FrankenBot, a VLM-driven, brain-morphic robotic manipulation framework that achieves both comprehensive functionality and high operational efficiency. Our framework includes a suite of components, decoupling a part of key functions from frequent VLM calls, striking an optimal balance between functional completeness and system efficiency. Specifically, we map task planning, policy generation, memory management, and low-level interfacing to the cortex, cerebellum, temporal lobe-hippocampus complex, and brainstem, respectively, and design efficient coordination mechanisms for the modules. We conducted comprehensive experiments in both simulation and real-world robotic environments, demonstrating that our method offers significant advantages in anomaly detection and handling, long-term memory, operational efficiency, and stability -- all without requiring any fine-tuning or retraining.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.21840v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The intricate linguistic, stylistic, and metrical aspects of Persian classical poetry pose a challenge for computational authorship attribution. In this work, we present a versatile framework to determine authorship among 67 prominent poets. We employ a multi-input neural framework consisting of a transformer-based language encoder complemented by features addressing the semantic, stylometric, and metrical dimensions of Persian poetry. Our feature set encompasses 100-dimensional Word2Vec embeddings, seven stylometric measures, and categorical encodings of poetic form and meter. We compiled a vast corpus of 647,653 verses of the Ganjoor digital collection, validating the data through strict preprocessing and author verification while preserving poem-level splitting to prevent overlap. This work employs verse-level classification and majority and weighted voting schemes in evaluation, revealing that weighted voting yields 71% accuracy. We further investigate threshold-based decision filtering, allowing the model to generate highly confident predictions, achieving 97% accuracy at a 0.9 threshold, though at lower coverage. Our work focuses on the integration of deep representational forms with domain-specific features for improved authorship attribution. The results illustrate the potential of our approach for automated classification and the contribution to stylistic analysis, authorship disputes, and general computational literature research. This research will facilitate further research on multilingual author attribution, style shift, and generative modeling of Persian poetry.",

Though dense facial landmark is highly demanded in various scenarios, e.g., cosmetic medicine and facial beautification, most works only consider sparse face alignment. To address this problem, we present a framework that can enrich landmark density by existing sparse landmark datasets, e.g., 300W with 68 points and WFLW with 98 points. Firstly, we observe that the local patches along each semantic contour are highly similar in appearance. Then, we propose a weakly-supervised idea of learning the refinement ability on original sparse landmarks and adapting this ability to enriched dense landmarks. Meanwhile, several operators are devised and organized together to implement the idea. Finally, the trained model is applied as a plug-and-play module to the existing face alignment networks. To evaluate our method, we manually label the dense landmarks on 300W testset. Our method yields state-of-the-art accuracy not only in newly-constructed dense 300W testset but also in the original sparse 300W and WFLW testsets without additional cost.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.14968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Physical caregiving robots hold promise for improving the quality of life of millions worldwide who require assistance with feeding. However, in-home meal assistance remains challenging due to the diversity of activities (e.g., eating, drinking, mouth wiping), contexts (e.g., socializing, watching TV), food items, and user preferences that arise during deployment. In this work, we propose FEAST, a flexible mealtime-assistance system that can be personalized in-the-wild to meet the unique needs of individual care recipients. Developed in collaboration with two community researchers and informed by a formative study with a diverse group of care recipients, our system is guided by three key tenets for in-the-wild personalization: adaptability, transparency, and safety. FEAST embodies these principles through: (i) modular hardware that enables switching between assisted feeding, drinking, and mouth-wiping, (ii) diverse interaction methods, including a web interface, head gestures, and physical buttons, to accommodate diverse functional abilities and preferences, and (iii) parameterized behavior trees that can be safely and transparently adapted using a large language model. We evaluate our system based on the personalization requirements identified in our formative study, demonstrating that FEAST offers a wide range of transparent and safe adaptations and outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline limited to fixed customizations. To demonstrate real-world applicability, we conduct an in-home user study with two care recipients (who are community researchers), feeding them three meals each across three diverse scenarios. We further assess FEAST's ecological validity by evaluating with an Occupational Therapist previously unfamiliar with the system. In all cases, users successfully personalize FEAST to meet their individual needs and preferences. Website: https://emprise.cs.cornell.edu/feast",

    "description": "arXiv:2410.10926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Instruction tuning is a crucial step in improving the responsiveness of pretrained large language models (LLMs) to human instructions. Federated learning (FL) helps to exploit the use of vast private instruction data from clients, becoming popular for LLM tuning by improving data diversity. Existing federated tuning simply consumes all local data, causing excessive computational overhead and overfitting to local data, while centralized data-efficient solutions are not suitable for FL due to privacy concerns. This work presents FedHDS, a federated data-efficient instruction tuning approach, which tunes LLMs with a representative subset of edge-side data. It reduces the data redundancy at both intra- and inter-client levels without sharing raw data. Experiments with various LLMs, datasets and partitions show that FedHDS improves Rouge-L on unseen tasks by an average of 10.72% over the SOTA full-data federated instruction tuning methods, while using less than 1.5% of the data samples, improving training efficiency by up to tens of times.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.08010v4 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: We investigate the mechanism underlying a previously identified phenomenon in Vision Transformers -- the emergence of high-norm tokens that lead to noisy attention maps. We observe that in multiple models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2), a sparse set of neurons is responsible for concentrating high-norm activations on outlier tokens, leading to irregular attention patterns and degrading downstream visual processing. While the existing solution for removing these outliers involves retraining models from scratch with additional learned register tokens, we use our findings to create a training-free approach to mitigate these artifacts. By shifting the high-norm activations from our discovered register neurons into an additional untrained token, we can mimic the effect of register tokens on a model already trained without registers. We demonstrate that our method produces cleaner attention and feature maps, enhances performance over base models across multiple downstream visual tasks, and achieves results comparable to models explicitly trained with register tokens. We then extend test-time registers to off-the-shelf vision-language models to improve their interpretability. Our results suggest that test-time registers effectively take on the role of register tokens at test-time, offering a training-free solution for any pre-trained model released without them.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.21931v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown promise in enhancing recommendation systems by incorporating external context into large language model prompts. However, existing RAG-based approaches often rely on static retrieval heuristics and fail to capture nuanced user preferences in dynamic recommendation scenarios. In this work, we introduce ARAG, an Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework for Personalized Recommendation, which integrates a multi-agent collaboration mechanism into the RAG pipeline. To better understand the long-term and session behavior of the user, ARAG leverages four specialized LLM-based agents: a User Understanding Agent that summarizes user preferences from long-term and session contexts, a Natural Language Inference (NLI) Agent that evaluates semantic alignment between candidate items retrieved by RAG and inferred intent, a context summary agent that summarizes the findings of NLI agent, and an Item Ranker Agent that generates a ranked list of recommendations based on contextual fit. We evaluate ARAG accross three datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that ARAG significantly outperforms standard RAG and recency-based baselines, achieving up to 42.1% improvement in NDCG@5 and 35.5% in Hit@5. We also, conduct an ablation study to analyse the effect by different components of ARAG. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating agentic reasoning into retrieval-augmented recommendation and provide new directions for LLM-based personalization.",

    "description": "arXiv:2504.20118v4 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) represents a rich repository of ancient medical knowledge that continues to play an important role in modern healthcare. Due to the complexity and breadth of the TCM literature, the integration of AI technologies is critical for its modernization and broader accessibility. However, this integration poses considerable challenges, including the interpretation of obscure classical Chinese texts and the modeling of intricate semantic relationships among TCM concepts. In this paper, we develop OpenTCM, an LLM-based system that combines a domain-specific TCM knowledge graph and Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG). First, we extract more than 3.73 million classical Chinese characters from 68 gynecological books in the Chinese Medical Classics Database, with the help of TCM and gynecology experts. Second, we construct a comprehensive multi-relational knowledge graph comprising more than 48,000 entities and 152,000 interrelationships, using customized prompts and Chinese-oriented LLMs such as DeepSeek and Kimi to ensure high-fidelity semantic understanding. Last, we empower OpenTCM with GraphRAG, enabling high-fidelity ingredient knowledge retrieval and diagnostic question-answering without model fine-tuning. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that OpenTCM achieves mean expert scores (MES) of 4.378 in ingredient information retrieval and 4.045 in diagnostic question-answering tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions in real-world TCM use cases.",
    "summary": "arXiv:2504.20118v4 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) represents a rich repository of ancient medical knowledge that continues to play an important role in modern healthcare. Due to the complexity and breadth of the TCM literature, the integration of AI technologies is critical for its modernization and broader accessibility. However, this integration poses considerable challenges, including the interpretation of obscure classical Chinese texts and the modeling of intricate semantic relationships among TCM concepts. In this paper, we develop OpenTCM, an LLM-based system that combines a domain-specific TCM knowledge graph and Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG). First, we extract more than 3.73 million classical Chinese characters from 68 gynecological books in the Chinese Medical Classics Database, with the help of TCM and gynecology experts. Second, we construct a comprehensive multi-relational knowledge graph comprising more than 48,000 entities and 152,000 interrelationships, using customized prompts and Chinese-oriented LLMs such as DeepSeek and Kimi to ensure high-fidelity semantic understanding.

    "description": "arXiv:2506.21609v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Recently, there have been notable advancements in large language models (LLMs), demonstrating their growing abilities in complex reasoning. However, existing research largely overlooks a thorough and systematic comparison of these models' reasoning processes and outputs, particularly regarding their self-reflection pattern (also termed 'Aha moment') and the interconnections across diverse domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for analyzing the reasoning characteristics of four cutting-edge large reasoning models (GPT-o1, DeepSeek-R1, Kimi-k1.5, and Grok-3) using keywords statistic and LLM-as-a-judge paradigm. Our approach connects their internal thinking processes with their final outputs. A diverse dataset consists of real-world scenario-based questions covering logical deduction, causal inference, and multi-step problem-solving. Additionally, a set of metrics is put forward to assess both the coherence of reasoning and the accuracy of the outputs. The research results uncover various patterns of how these models balance exploration and exploitation, deal with problems, and reach conclusions during the reasoning process. Through quantitative and qualitative comparisons, disparities among these models are identified in aspects such as the depth of reasoning, the reliance on intermediate steps, and the degree of similarity between their thinking processes and output patterns and those of GPT-o1. This work offers valuable insights into the trade-off between computational efficiency and reasoning robustness and provides practical recommendations for enhancing model design and evaluation in practical applications. We publicly release our project at: https://github.com/ChangWenhan/FromThinking2Output",

    "description": "arXiv:2504.04466v4 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Loops--short audio segments designed for seamless repetition--are central to many music genres, particularly those rooted in dance and electronic styles. However, current generative music models struggle to produce truly loopable audio, as generating a short waveform alone does not guarantee a smooth transition from its endpoint back to its start, often resulting in audible discontinuities. We address this gap by modifying a non-autoregressive model (MAGNeT) to generate tokens in a circular pattern, letting the model attend to the beginning of the audio when creating its ending. This inference-only approach results in generations that are aware of future context and loop naturally, without the need for any additional training or data. We evaluate the consistency of loop transitions by computing token perplexity around the seam of the loop, observing a 55% improvement. Blind listening tests further confirm significant perceptual gains over baseline methods, improving mean ratings by 70%. Taken together, these results highlight the effectiveness of inference-only approaches in improving generative models and underscore the advantages of non-autoregressive methods for context-aware music generation.",
