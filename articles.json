    "description": "We’ve fine-tuned the 774M parameter GPT-2 language model using human feedback for various tasks, successfully matching the preferences of the external human labelers, though those preferences did not always match our own. Specifically, for summarization tasks the labelers preferred sentences copied wholesale from the input (we’d only asked them to ensure accuracy), so our models learned to copy. Summarization required 60k human labels; simpler tasks which continue text in various styles required only 5k. Our motivation is to move safety techniques closer to the general task of “machines talking to humans,” which we believe is key to extracting information about human values.",

To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage Brain-to-Population Graph Learning (B2P-GL) framework that integrates the semantic similarity of brain regions and condition-based population graph modeling. In the first stage, termed brain representation learning, we leverage brain atlas knowledge from GPT-4 to enrich the graph representation and refine the brain graph through an adaptive node reassignment graph attention network. In the second stage, termed population disorder diagnosis, phenotypic data is incorporated into population graph construction and feature fusion to mitigate confounding effects and enhance diagnosis performance. Experiments on the ABIDE I, ADHD-200, and Rest-meta-MDD datasets show that B2P-GL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy while enhancing interpretability. Overall, our proposed framework offers a reliable and personalized approach to brain disorder diagnosis, advancing clinical applicability.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.16929v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Neonatal death is still a concerning reality for underdeveloped and even some developed countries. Worldwide data indicate that 26.693 babies out of 1,000 births die, according to Macro Trades. To reduce this number, early prediction of endangered babies is crucial. Such prediction enables the opportunity to take ample care of the child and mother so that early child death can be avoided. In this context, machine learning was used to determine whether a newborn baby is at risk. To train the predictive model, historical data of 1.4 million newborns was used. Machine learning and deep learning techniques such as logical regression, K-nearest neighbor, random forest classifier, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), convolutional neural network, and long short-term memory (LSTM) were implemented using the dataset to identify the most accurate model for predicting neonatal mortality. Among the machine learning algorithms, XGBoost and random forest classifier achieved the best accuracy with 94%, while among the deep learning models, LSTM delivered the highest accuracy with 99%. Therefore, using LSTM appears to be the most suitable approach to predict whether precautionary measures for a child are necessary.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.16052v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The proliferation of online communication platforms has created unprecedented opportunities for global connectivity while simultaneously enabling harmful behaviors such as cyberbullying, which affects approximately 54.4% of teenagers according to recent research. This paper presents a hybrid architecture that combines the contextual understanding capabilities of transformer-based models with the pattern recognition strengths of broad learning systems for effective cyberbullying detection. This approach integrates a modified DeBERTa model augmented with Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks and sentiment analysis capabilities with a Gated Broad Learning System (GBLS) classifier, creating a synergistic framework that outperforms existing approaches across multiple benchmark datasets. The proposed ModifiedDeBERTa + GBLS model achieved good performance on four English datasets: 79.3% accuracy on HateXplain, 95.41% accuracy on SOSNet, 91.37% accuracy on Mendeley-I, and 94.67% accuracy on Mendeley-II. Beyond performance gains, the framework incorporates comprehensive explainability mechanisms including token-level attribution analysis, LIME-based local interpretations, and confidence calibration, addressing critical transparency requirements in automated content moderation. Ablation studies confirm the meaningful contribution of each architectural component, while failure case analysis reveals specific challenges in detecting implicit bias and sarcastic content, providing valuable insights for future improvements in cyberbullying detection systems.",

The proposed ModifiedDeBERTa + GBLS model achieved good performance on four English datasets: 79.3% accuracy on HateXplain, 95.41% accuracy on SOSNet, 91.37% accuracy on Mendeley-I, and 94.67% accuracy on Mendeley-II. Beyond performance gains, the framework incorporates comprehensive explainability mechanisms including token-level attribution analysis, LIME-based local interpretations, and confidence calibration, addressing critical transparency requirements in automated content moderation. Ablation studies confirm the meaningful contribution of each architectural component, while failure case analysis reveals specific challenges in detecting implicit bias and sarcastic content, providing valuable insights for future improvements in cyberbullying detection systems.",

    "description": "arXiv:2411.04105v4 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Due to the size and complexity of modern large language models (LLMs), it has proven challenging to uncover the underlying mechanisms that models use to solve reasoning problems. For instance, is their reasoning for a specific problem localized to certain parts of the network? Do they break down the reasoning problem into modular components that are then executed as sequential steps as we go deeper in the model? To better understand the reasoning capability of LLMs, we study a minimal propositional logic problem that requires combining multiple facts to arrive at a solution. By studying this problem on Mistral and Gemma models, up to 27B parameters, we illuminate the core components the models use to solve such logic problems. From a mechanistic interpretability point of view, we use causal mediation analysis to uncover the pathways and components of the LLMs' reasoning processes. Then, we offer fine-grained insights into the functions of attention heads in different layers. We not only find a sparse circuit that computes the answer, but we decompose it into sub-circuits that have four distinct and modular uses. Finally, we reveal that three distinct models -- Mistral-7B, Gemma-2-9B and Gemma-2-27B -- contain analogous but not identical mechanisms.",

However, existing approaches introduce unnecessary complexity: they cache the full sampling trajectory, depend on differentiable reward models or large preference datasets, or require specialized guidance techniques. Motivated by the 'golden noise' hypothesis -- that certain initial noise samples can consistently yield superior alignment -- we introduce Noise PPO, a minimalist RL algorithm that leaves the pre-trained diffusion model entirely frozen and learns a prompt-conditioned initial noise generator. Our approach requires no trajectory storage, reward backpropagation, or complex guidance tricks. Extensive experiments show that optimizing the initial noise distribution consistently improves alignment and sample quality over the original model, with the most significant gains at low inference steps.

    "description": "arXiv:2506.16659v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) typically relies on adaptive optimizers such as Adam, which require significant memory to maintain first- and second-moment matrices, known as optimizer states. While recent works such as GaLore, Fira, and APOLLO have proposed state-compressed variants to reduce memory consumption, a fundamental question remains: What is the minimal amount of optimizer state that is truly necessary to retain state-of-the-art performance in LLM pretraining? In this work, we systematically investigate this question using a bottom-up approach. We find that two memory- and compute-efficient optimization techniques are particularly effective: (1) column-wise gradient normalization significantly boosts the performance of plain SGD without requiring momentum; and (2) adding first-order momentum only to the output layer - where gradient variance is highest - yields performance competitive with fully adaptive methods such as Muon. Based on these insights, we propose SCALE (Stochastic Column-normalized Last-layer Momentum), a new optimizer that combines column-normalized SGD with last-layer momentum, where column normalization refers to normalizing the gradient along the output dimension. Across multiple LLaMA models (60M-1B), SCALE matches or exceeds the performance of Adam while using only 35-45% of the total memory. It also consistently outperforms memory-efficient optimizers such as GaLore, Fira, and APOLLO, making it a strong candidate for large-scale pretraining under memory constraints. For the LLaMA 7B model, SCALE outperforms the state-of-the-art method APOLLO in terms of both perplexity and memory consumption. In addition, our method serves as a minimalist baseline for more sophisticated optimizer design.",

However, in large-scale recommendation systems, this approach becomes increasingly cumbersome due to the redundancy and sheer scale of the token space. To overcome these limitations, recent research has explored the use of semantic tokens as an alternative to ID tokens, which typically leveraged reconstruction-based strategies, like RQ-VAE, to quantize content embeddings and significantly reduce the embedding size. However, reconstructive quantization aims for the precise reconstruction of each item embedding independently, which conflicts with the goal of generative retrieval tasks focusing more on differentiating among items. Moreover, multi-modal side information of items, such as descriptive text and images, geographical knowledge in location-based recommendation services, has been shown to be effective in improving recommendations by providing richer contexts for interactions. Nevertheless, effectively integrating such complementary knowledge into existing generative recommendation frameworks remains challenging. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel unsupervised deep quantization exclusively based on contrastive learning, named SimCIT (a Simple Contrastive Item Tokenization framework). Specifically, different from existing reconstruction-based strategies, SimCIT propose to use a learnable residual quantization module to align with the signals from different modalities of the items, which combines multi-modal knowledge alignment and semantic tokenization in a mutually beneficial contrastive learning framework.

    "description": "arXiv:2506.13923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: We study the process through which reasoning models trained with reinforcement learning on verifiable rewards (RLVR) can learn to solve new problems. We find that RLVR drives performance in two main ways: (1) by compressing pass@$k$ into pass@1 and (2) via 'capability gain' in which models learn to solve new problems that they previously could not solve even at high $k$.

We find that RLVR drives performance in two main ways: (1) by compressing pass@$k$ into pass@1 and (2) via 'capability gain' in which models learn to solve new problems that they previously could not solve even at high $k$. We find that while capability gain exists across model scales, learning to solve new problems is primarily driven through self-distillation.

    "description": "arXiv:2506.15980v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Sign Language Video Generation (SLVG) seeks to generate identity-preserving sign language videos from spoken language texts. Existing methods primarily rely on the single coarse condition (eg, skeleton sequences) as the intermediary to bridge the translation model and the video generation model, which limits both the naturalness and expressiveness of the generated videos. To overcome these limitations, we propose SignViP, a novel SLVG framework that incorporates multiple fine-grained conditions for improved generation fidelity. Rather than directly translating error-prone high-dimensional conditions, SignViP adopts a discrete tokenization paradigm to integrate and represent fine-grained conditions (ie, fine-grained poses and 3D hands). SignViP contains three core components. (1) Sign Video Diffusion Model is jointly trained with a multi-condition encoder to learn continuous embeddings that encapsulate fine-grained motion and appearance. (2) Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) Autoencoder is further trained to compress and quantize these embeddings into discrete tokens for compact representation of the conditions. (3) Multi-Condition Token Translator is trained to translate spoken language text to discrete multi-condition tokens. During inference, Multi-Condition Token Translator first translates the spoken language text into discrete multi-condition tokens. These tokens are then decoded to continuous embeddings by FSQ Autoencoder, which are subsequently injected into Sign Video Diffusion Model to guide video generation. Experimental results show that SignViP achieves state-of-the-art performance across metrics, including video quality, temporal coherence, and semantic fidelity.

However, existing research predominantly concentrates on the security of general large language models, lacking specialized methodologies for establishing safety benchmarks and input moderation tailored to embodied agents. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a novel input moderation framework, meticulously designed to safeguard embodied agents. This framework encompasses the entire pipeline, including taxonomy definition, dataset curation, moderator architecture, model training, and rigorous evaluation. Notably, we introduce EAsafetyBench, a meticulously crafted safety benchmark engineered to facilitate both the training and stringent assessment of moderators specifically designed for embodied agents. Furthermore, we propose Pinpoint, an innovative prompt-decoupled input moderation scheme that harnesses a masked attention mechanism to effectively isolate and mitigate the influence of functional prompts on moderation tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on diverse benchmark datasets and models validate the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that our methodologies achieve an impressive average detection accuracy of 94.58%, surpassing the performance of existing state-of-the-art techniques, alongside an exceptional moderation processing time of merely 0.002 seconds per instance.",

To address this issue, the proposed algorithm, coined DOCSAT, dissipates oversatisfied constraints (DOC), i.e. reduces their unfavorable abundance so as to render them critical. We analyze and benchmark our algorithm on a randomly generated sample of hard but satisfiable 3-SAT instances with varying problem sizes up to N=15000. Quite remarkably, we find that DOCSAT outperforms both WalkSAT and other well known algorithms including the complete solver Kissat, even when comparing its ability to solve the hardest quintile of the sample to the average performance of its competitors. The essence of DOCSAT may be seen as a way of harnessing statistical structure beyond the primary cost function of a combinatorial problem to avoid or escape local minima traps in stochastic local search, which opens avenues for generalization to other optimization problems.",

    "description": "arXiv:2503.02832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: In modern large language models (LLMs), LLM alignment is of crucial importance and is typically achieved through methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO). However, in most existing methods for LLM alignment, all tokens in the response are optimized using a sparse, response-level reward or preference annotation. The ignorance of token-level rewards may erroneously punish high-quality tokens or encourage low-quality tokens, resulting in suboptimal performance and slow convergence speed. To address this issue, we propose AlignDistil, an RLHF-equivalent distillation method for token-level reward optimization. Specifically, we introduce the reward learned by DPO into the RLHF objective and theoretically prove the equivalence between this objective and a token-level distillation process, where the teacher distribution linearly combines the logits from the DPO model and a reference model. On this basis, we further bridge the accuracy gap between the reward from the DPO model and the pure reward model, by building a contrastive DPO reward with a normal and a reverse DPO model. Moreover, to avoid under- and over-optimization on different tokens, we design a token adaptive logit extrapolation mechanism to construct an appropriate teacher distribution for each token. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our AlignDistil over existing methods and showcase fast convergence due to its token-level distributional reward optimization.",

ALTA complements and extends this prior work, offering the ability to express loops and to compile programs to Universal Transformers, among other advantages. ALTA allows us to constructively show how Transformers can represent length-invariant algorithms for computing parity and addition, as well as a solution to the SCAN benchmark of compositional generalization tasks, without requiring intermediate scratchpad decoding steps. We also propose tools to analyze cases where the expressibility of an algorithm is established, but end-to-end training on a given training set fails to induce behavior consistent with the desired algorithm. To this end, we explore training from ALTA execution traces as a more fine-grained supervision signal. This enables additional experiments and theoretical analyses relating the learnability of various algorithms to data availability and modeling decisions, such as positional encodings.

The legitimacy of these panels hinges on their representation of the broader population, but panelists often drop out, leading to an unbalanced composition. Although participant attrition is mitigated in practice by alternates, their selection is not taken into account by existing methods. To address this gap, we introduce an optimization framework for alternate selection. Our algorithmic approach, which leverages learning-theoretic machinery, estimates dropout probabilities using historical data and selects alternates to minimize expected misrepresentation. We establish theoretical guarantees for our approach, including worst-case bounds on sample complexity (with implications for computational efficiency) and on loss when panelists' probabilities of dropping out are mis-estimated.

Applying traditional systems optimizations such as parallelism and pipelining in compound AI systems is difficult because each component has different constraints in terms of the granularity and type of data that it ingests. New data is often generated during intermediate computations, and text streams may be split into smaller, independent fragments (such as documents to sentences) which may then be re-aggregated at later parts of the computation. Due to this complexity, existing systems to serve compound AI queries do not fully take advantage of parallelism and pipelining opportunities. We present Alto, a framework that automatically optimizes execution of compound AI queries through streaming and parallelism. Bento introduces a new abstraction called nested ancestry, a metadata hierarchy that allows the system to correctly track partial outputs and aggregate data across the heterogeneous constraints of the components of compound AI applications. This metadata is automatically inferred from the programming model, allowing developers to express complex dataflow patterns without needing to reason manually about the details of routing and aggregation. Implementations of four applications in Alto outperform or match implementations in LangGraph, a popular existing AI programming framework.

The key feature of our evaluation benchmark lies in its interactive evaluation protocol - for example, in DFS, the availability of each node's connected edge is contingent upon the model's traversal to that node, thereby necessitating the LLM's ability to effectively remember visited nodes and strategize subsequent moves considering the possible environmental feedback in the future steps. We comprehensively build AQA-Bench with three different algorithms, namely binary search, depth-first search, and breadth-first search, and to evaluate the sequential reasoning ability of 14 different LLMs. Our investigations reveal several interesting findings: (1) Closed-source models like GPT-4 and Gemini generally show much stronger sequential reasoning ability, significantly outperforming open-source LLMs. (2) Naively providing in-context examples may inadvertently hurt few-shot performance in an interactive environment due to over-fitting to examples. (3) Instead of using optimal steps from another test case as the in-context example, a very limited number of predecessor steps in the current test case following the optimal policy can substantially boost small models' performance. (4) The performance gap between weak models and strong models is greatly due to the incapability of weak models to start well. (5) The scaling correlation between performance and model size is not always significant, sometimes even showcasing an inverse trend. We hope our study can catalyze future work on advancing the understanding and enhancement of LLMs' capabilities in sequential reasoning.

Extensive experiments were conducted in both text-based simulations and a real office environment over the course of a month and a half. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, showing that AssistantX can reactively respond to user instructions, actively adjust strategies to adapt to contingencies, and proactively seek assistance from humans to ensure successful task completion.

    "description": "arXiv:2506.16001v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Time series forecasting requires architectures that simultaneously achieve three competing objectives: (1) strict temporal causality for reliable predictions, (2) sub-quadratic complexity for practical scalability, and (3) multi-scale pattern recognition for accurate long-horizon forecasting. We introduce AutoHFormer, a hierarchical autoregressive transformer that addresses these challenges through three key innovations: 1) Hierarchical Temporal Modeling: Our architecture decomposes predictions into segment-level blocks processed in parallel, followed by intra-segment sequential refinement. This dual-scale approach maintains temporal coherence while enabling efficient computation. 2) Dynamic Windowed Attention: The attention mechanism employs learnable causal windows with exponential decay, reducing complexity while preserving precise temporal relationships. This design avoids both the anti-causal violations of standard transformers and the sequential bottlenecks of RNN hybrids. 3) Adaptive Temporal Encoding: a novel position encoding system is adopted to capture time patterns at multiple scales. It combines fixed oscillating patterns for short-term variations with learnable decay rates for long-term trends. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that AutoHFormer 10.76X faster training and 6.06X memory reduction compared to PatchTST on PEMS08, while maintaining consistent accuracy across 96-720 step horizons in most of cases.

    "description": "arXiv:2506.04287v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Training large language model (LLM) agents to acquire necessary skills and perform diverse tasks within an environment is gaining interest as a means to enable open-endedness. However, creating the training dataset for their skill acquisition faces several challenges. Manual trajectory collection requires significant human effort. Another approach, where LLMs directly propose tasks to learn, is often invalid, as the LLMs lack knowledge of which tasks are actually feasible. Moreover, the generated data may not provide a meaningful learning signal, as agents often already perform well on the proposed tasks. To address this, we propose a novel automatic skill discovery framework EXIF for LLM-powered agents, designed to improve the feasibility of generated target behaviors while accounting for the agents' capabilities. Our method adopts an exploration-first strategy by employing an exploration agent (Alice) to train the target agent (Bob) to learn essential skills in the environment. Specifically, Alice first interacts with the environment to retrospectively generate a feasible, environment-grounded skill dataset, which is then used to train Bob. Crucially, we incorporate an iterative feedback loop, where Alice evaluates Bob's performance to identify areas for improvement. This feedback then guides Alice's next round of exploration, forming a closed-loop data generation process. Experiments on Webshop and Crafter demonstrate EXIF's ability to effectively discover meaningful skills and iteratively expand the capabilities of the trained agent without any human intervention, achieving substantial performance improvements. Interestingly, we observe that setting Alice to the same model as Bob also notably improves performance, demonstrating EXIF's potential for building a self-evolving system.",

As such, detecting test-time dataset shift is not sufficient: precisely identifying which type of shift has occurred is critical. In this work, we propose the first unsupervised dataset shift identification framework for imaging datasets, effectively distinguishing between prevalence shift (caused by a change in the label distribution), covariate shift (caused by a change in input characteristics) and mixed shifts (simultaneous prevalence and covariate shifts). We discuss the importance of self-supervised encoders for detecting subtle covariate shifts and propose a novel shift detector leveraging both self-supervised encoders and task model outputs for improved shift detection.

    "description": "arXiv:2406.04220v5 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved natural language processing (NLP) applications. However, these models often inherit biases from their training data. While several datasets exist for bias detection, most are limited to one or two NLP tasks, typically classification or evaluation, and lack comprehensive coverage across a broader range of tasks. To address this gap, we introduce the Bias Evaluations Across Domains (BEADs) dataset, designed to support a wide range of NLP tasks, including text classification, token classification, bias quantification, and benign language generation. A key contribution of this work is the gold-standard annotation provided by GPT-4 for scalability, with expert verification to ensure high reliability. BEADs can be used for both fine-tuning models (for classification and generation tasks) and evaluating LLM behavior. Our findings show that BEADs effectively surfaces various biases during model fine-tuning and helps reduce biases in language generation tasks while maintaining output quality. The dataset also highlights prevalent demographic biases in LLMs during evaluation.

    "summary": "arXiv:2406.04220v5 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved natural language processing (NLP) applications. However, these models often inherit biases from their training data. While several datasets exist for bias detection, most are limited to one or two NLP tasks, typically classification or evaluation, and lack comprehensive coverage across a broader range of tasks. To address this gap, we introduce the Bias Evaluations Across Domains (BEADs) dataset, designed to support a wide range of NLP tasks, including text classification, token classification, bias quantification, and benign language generation. A key contribution of this work is the gold-standard annotation provided by GPT-4 for scalability, with expert verification to ensure high reliability. BEADs can be used for both fine-tuning models (for classification and generation tasks) and evaluating LLM behavior. Our findings show that BEADs effectively surfaces various biases during model fine-tuning and helps reduce biases in language generation tasks while maintaining output quality. The dataset also highlights prevalent demographic biases in LLMs during evaluation. We release BEADs as a practical resource for detecting and mitigating bias across domains, supporting the development of responsible AI systems.

The current diverse planning formulations encode the diversity model as a distance function, which is computational inexpensive when comparing two plans. However, such modelling approach limits what can be encoded as measure of diversity, as well as the ability to explain why two plans are different. This paper introduces a novel approach to the diverse planning problem, allowing for more expressive modelling of diversity using a n-dimensional grid representation, where each dimension corresponds to a user-defined feature. Furthermore, we present a novel toolkit that generates diverse plans based on such customisable diversity models, called emph{Behaviour Planning}. We provide an implementation for behaviour planning using planning-as-satisfiability. An empirical evaluation of our implementation shows that behaviour planning significantly outperforms the current diverse planning method in generating diverse plans measured on our new customisable diversity models.

Additionally, existing benchmarks for video synchronization lack generality and reproducibility, restricting progress in the field. In this work, we introduce VideoSync, a video synchronization framework that operates independently of specific feature extraction methods, such as human pose estimation, enabling broader applicability across different content types. We evaluate our system on newly composed datasets covering single-human, multi-human, and non-human scenarios, providing both the methodology and code for dataset creation to establish reproducible benchmarks. Our analysis reveals biases in prior SOTA work, particularly in SeSyn-Net's preprocessing pipeline, leading to inflated performance claims. We correct these biases and propose a more rigorous evaluation framework, demonstrating that VideoSync outperforms existing approaches, including SeSyn-Net, under fair experimental conditions. Additionally, we explore various synchronization offset prediction methods, identifying a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model as the most effective.

A key challenge in unlearning involves balancing between forget quality (effectively unlearning undesirable information) and retain quality (maintaining good performance on other, general tasks). Unfortunately, as we show, current LLM unlearning benchmarks contain highly disparate forget and retain sets -- painting a false picture of the effectiveness of LLM unlearning methods. This can be particularly problematic because it opens the door for benign perturbations, such as relearning attacks, to easily reveal supposedly unlearned knowledge once models are deployed. To address this, we present $texttt{BLUR}$: a benchmark for LLM unlearning that provides more realistic scenarios of forget-retain overlap. $texttt{BLUR}$ significantly expands on existing unlearning benchmarks by providing extended evaluation tasks, combined forget/retain queries, and relearning datasets of varying degrees of difficulty. Despite the benign nature of the queries considered, we find that the performance of existing methods drops significantly when evaluated on $texttt{BLUR}$, with simple approaches performing better on average than more recent methods.

    "description": "arXiv:2505.13563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: With the rise of the fine-tuned--pretrained paradigm, storing numerous fine-tuned models for multi-tasking creates significant storage overhead. Delta compression alleviates this by storing only the pretrained model and the highly compressed delta weights (the differences between fine-tuned and pretrained model weights). However, existing methods fail to maintain both high compression and performance, and often rely on data. To address these challenges, we propose UltraDelta, the first data-free delta compression pipeline that achieves both ultra-high compression and strong performance. UltraDelta is designed to minimize redundancy, maximize information, and stabilize performance across inter-layer, intra-layer, and global dimensions, using three key components: (1) Variance-Based Mixed Sparsity Allocation assigns sparsity based on variance, giving lower sparsity to high-variance layers to preserve inter-layer information. (2) Distribution-Aware Compression applies uniform quantization and then groups parameters by value, followed by group-wise pruning, to better preserve intra-layer distribution. (3) Trace-Norm-Guided Rescaling uses the trace norm of delta weights to estimate a global rescaling factor, improving model stability under higher compression. Extensive experiments across (a) large language models (fine-tuned on LLaMA-2 7B and 13B) with up to 133x, (b) general NLP models (RoBERTa-base, T5-base) with up to 800x, (c) vision models (ViT-B/32, ViT-L/14) with up to 400x, and (d) multi-modal models (BEiT-3) with 40x compression ratio, demonstrate that UltraDelta consistently outperforms existing methods, especially under ultra-high compression.",

Our results reveal that while LLMs demonstrate high replication rates for main effects (73-81%) and moderate to strong success with interaction effects (46-63%), They consistently produce larger effect sizes than human studies, with Fisher Z values approximately 2-3 times higher than human studies. Notably, LLMs show significantly lower replication rates for studies involving socially sensitive topics such as race, gender and ethics. When original studies reported null findings, LLMs produced significant results at remarkably high rates (68-83%) - while this could reflect cleaner data with less noise, as evidenced by narrower confidence intervals, it also suggests potential risks of effect size overestimation.

This requires overcoming a challenge: the text-boundedness of LLMs appears, on the face of it, to prevent them engaging in the right sorts of tasks.",

    "title": "Can We Detect Failures Without Failure Data? Uncertainty-Aware Runtime Failure Detection for Imitation Learning Policies",
    "description": "arXiv:2503.08558v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Recent years have witnessed impressive robotic manipulation systems driven by advances in imitation learning and generative modeling, such as diffusion- and flow-based approaches. As robot policy performance increases, so does the complexity and time horizon of achievable tasks, inducing unexpected and diverse failure modes that are difficult to predict a priori. To enable trustworthy policy deployment in safety-critical human environments, reliable runtime failure detection becomes important during policy inference. However, most existing failure detection approaches rely on prior knowledge of failure modes and require failure data during training, which imposes a significant challenge in practicality and scalability. In response to these limitations, we present FAIL-Detect, a modular two-stage approach for failure detection in imitation learning-based robotic manipulation. To accurately identify failures from successful training data alone, we frame the problem as sequential out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. We first distill policy inputs and outputs into scalar signals that correlate with policy failures and capture epistemic uncertainty. FAIL-Detect then employs conformal prediction (CP) as a versatile framework for uncertainty quantification with statistical guarantees. Empirically, we thoroughly investigate both learned and post-hoc scalar signal candidates on diverse robotic manipulation tasks. Our experiments show learned signals to be mostly consistently effective, particularly when using our novel flow-based density estimator. Furthermore, our method detects failures more accurately and faster than state-of-the-art (SOTA) failure detection baselines. These results highlight the potential of FAIL-Detect to enhance the safety and reliability of imitation learning-based robotic systems as they progress toward real-world deployment.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.15538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Automated interpretability research aims to identify concepts encoded in neural network features to enhance human understanding of model behavior. Current feature description methods face two critical challenges: limited robustness and the flawed assumption that each neuron encodes only a single concept (monosemanticity), despite growing evidence that neurons are often polysemantic. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework that captures the inherent complexity of neural network features. Unlike prior approaches that assign a single description per feature, PRISM provides more nuanced descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features. We apply PRISM to language models and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods, demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is present (via a polysemanticity score).",

    "description": "arXiv:2502.13030v4 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: We consider the problem of conformal prediction under covariate shift. Given labeled data from a source domain and unlabeled data from a covariate shifted target domain, we seek to construct prediction sets with valid marginal coverage in the target domain. Most existing methods require estimating the unknown likelihood ratio function, which can be prohibitive for high-dimensional data such as images. To address this challenge, we introduce the likelihood ratio regularized quantile regression (LR-QR) algorithm, which combines the pinball loss with a novel choice of regularization in order to construct a threshold function without directly estimating the unknown likelihood ratio. We show that the LR-QR method has coverage at the desired level in the target domain, up to a small error term that we can control. Our proofs draw on a novel analysis of coverage via stability bounds from learning theory. Our experiments demonstrate that the LR-QR algorithm outperforms existing methods on high-dimensional prediction tasks, including a regression task for the Communities and Crime dataset, an image classification task from the WILDS repository, and an LLM question-answering task on the MMLU benchmark.",

These interdependencies are typically represented as mathematical expressions that define relations between process parameters, supporting tasks such as calculation, validation, and simulation. To support cross-context application and knowledge reuse, such expressions are often defined in a generic form and applied across multiple process contexts. This highlights the necessity of a consistent and semantically coherent model to ensure the correctness of data retrieval and interpretation. Consequently, dedicated mechanisms are required to address key challenges such as selecting context-relevant data, ensuring unit compatibility between variables and data elements, and verifying the completeness of input data required for evaluating mathematical expressions. This paper presents a set of verification mechanisms for a previously developed ontology-based process model that integrates standardized process semantics, data element definitions, and formal mathematical constructs. The approach includes (i) SPARQL-based filtering to retrieve process-relevant data, (ii) a unit consistency check based on expected-unit annotations and semantic classification, and (iii) a data completeness check to validate the evaluability of interdependencies.

This often results in heavily hard-coded behaviors that struggle to adapt, even with scenarios where goals can be achieved through relaxed planning. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) lead to planning systems that leverage commonsense reasoning but often at the cost of generating unfeasible and/or unsafe plans. To address these limitations, we present an approach integrating classical planning with LLMs, leveraging their ability to extract commonsense knowledge and ground actions. We propose a hierarchical formulation that enables robots to make unfeasible tasks tractable by defining functionally equivalent goals through gradual relaxation. This mechanism supports partial achievement of the intended objective, suited to the agent's specific context. Our method demonstrates its ability to adapt and execute tasks effectively within environments modeled using 3D Scene Graphs through comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

However, the synthesized controller only ensures that all the trajectories of the system converge to one single trajectory and, as such, does not impose any notion of optimality across an entire trajectory. Furthermore, constructing CCMs requires a known dynamics model and non-trivial effort in solving an infinite-dimensional convex feasibility problem, which limits its scalability to complex systems featuring high dimensionality with uncertainty. To address these issues, we propose to integrate CCMs into reinforcement learning (RL), where CCMs provide dynamics-informed feedback for learning control policies that minimize cumulative tracking error under unknown dynamics. We show that our algorithm, called contraction actor-critic (CAC), formally enhances the capability of CCMs to provide a set of contracting policies with the long-term optimality of RL in a fully automated setting.

To address this issue, we propose integrating geometric information--such as geometric pose--into the conformal procedure to reinstate its guarantees and ensure robustness under geometric shifts. In particular, we explore recent advancements on pose canonicalization as a suitable information extractor for this purpose. Evaluating the combined approach across discrete and continuous shifts and against equivariant and augmentation-based baselines, we find that integrating geometric information with CP yields a principled way to address geometric shifts while maintaining broad applicability to black-box predictors.",

    "title": "CRIA: A Cross-View Interaction and Instance-Adapted Pre-training Framework for Generalizable EEG Representations",
    "description": "arXiv:2506.16056v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The difficulty of extracting deep features from EEG data and effectively integrating information from multiple views presents significant challenges for developing a generalizable pretraining framework for EEG representation learning. However, most existing pre-training methods rely solely on the contextual semantics of a single view, failing to capture the complex and synergistic interactions among different perspectives, limiting the expressiveness and generalization of learned representations. To address these issues, this paper proposes CRIA, an adaptive framework that utilizes variable-length and variable-channel coding to achieve a unified representation of EEG data across different datasets. In this work, we define cross-view information as the integrated representation that emerges from the interaction among temporal, spectral, and spatial views of EEG signals. The model employs a cross-attention mechanism to fuse temporal, spectral, and spatial features effectively, and combines an attention matrix masking strategy based on the information bottleneck principle with a novel viewpoint masking pre-training scheme. Experimental results on the Temple University EEG corpus and the CHB-MIT dataset show that CRIA outperforms existing methods with the same pre-training conditions, achieving a balanced accuracy of 57.02% for multi-class event classification and 80.03% for anomaly detection, highlighting its strong generalization ability.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.15853v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) staining is a cornerstone of pathological analysis, offering reliable visualization of cellular morphology and tissue architecture for cancer diagnosis, subtyping, and grading. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining provides molecular insights by detecting specific proteins within tissues, enhancing diagnostic accuracy, and improving treatment planning. However, IHC staining is costly, time-consuming, and resource-intensive, requiring specialized expertise. To address these limitations, this study proposes HistoStainAlign, a novel deep learning framework that predicts IHC staining patterns directly from H&amp;E whole-slide images (WSIs) by learning joint representations of morphological and molecular features. The framework integrates paired H&amp;E and IHC embeddings through a contrastive training strategy, capturing complementary features across staining modalities without patch-level annotations or tissue registration. The model was evaluated on gastrointestinal and lung tissue WSIs with three commonly used IHC stains: P53, PD-L1, and Ki-67. HistoStainAlign achieved weighted F1 scores of 0.735 [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.670-0.799], 0.830 [95% CI: 0.772-0.886], and 0.723 [95% CI: 0.607-0.836], respectively for these three IHC stains. Embedding analyses demonstrated the robustness of the contrastive alignment in capturing meaningful cross-stain relationships. Comparisons with a baseline model further highlight the advantage of incorporating contrastive learning for improved stain pattern prediction. This study demonstrates the potential of computational approaches to serve as a pre-screening tool, helping prioritize cases for IHC staining and improving workflow efficiency.",

We provide rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical validation, showing that daDPO outperforms existing methods in restoring performance for pruned models and enhancing smaller LLM models.

Our method integrates world models with communication channels, enabling agents to predict environmental dynamics, estimate states from partial observations, and share critical information through bidirectional message exchange with contrastive learning for message alignment. Using a two-agent trajectory drawing task, we demonstrate that our communication-based approach outperforms non-communicative models when agents have divergent perceptual capabilities, achieving the second-best coordination after centralized models. Importantly, our decentralized approach with constraints preventing direct access to other agents' internal states facilitates the emergence of more meaningful symbol systems that accurately reflect environmental states.

Diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful tool for this task, combining DDIM inversion with conditional generation via classifier-free guidance (CFG). However, standard CFG applies a single global weight across all conditioning variables, which can lead to poor identity preservation and spurious attribute changes - a phenomenon known as attribute amplification. To address this, we propose Decoupled Classifier-Free Guidance (DCFG), a flexible and model-agnostic framework that introduces group-wise conditioning control. DCFG builds on an attribute-split embedding strategy that disentangles semantic inputs, enabling selective guidance on user-defined attribute groups. For counterfactual generation, we partition attributes into intervened and invariant sets based on a causal graph and apply distinct guidance to each.

    "description": "arXiv:2506.16608v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: We introduce a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework that treats distribution parameters as actions, redefining the boundary between agent and environment. This reparameterization makes the new action space continuous, regardless of the original action type (discrete, continuous, mixed, etc.). Under this new parameterization, we develop a generalized deterministic policy gradient estimator, Distribution Parameter Policy Gradient (DPPG), which has lower variance than the gradient in the original action space. Although learning the critic over distribution parameters poses new challenges, we introduce interpolated critic learning (ICL), a simple yet effective strategy to enhance learning, supported by insights from bandit settings. Building on TD3, a strong baseline for continuous control, we propose a practical DPPG-based actor-critic algorithm, Distribution Parameter Actor-Critic (DPAC). Empirically, DPAC outperforms TD3 in MuJoCo continuous control tasks from OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control Suite, and demonstrates competitive performance on the same environments with discretized action spaces.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.17144v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Traditional video-based tasks like soccer action spotting rely heavily on visual inputs, often requiring complex and computationally expensive models to process dense video data. In this work, we propose a shift from this video-centric approach to a text-based task, making it lightweight and scalable by utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) instead of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We posit that expert commentary, which provides rich, fine-grained descriptions and contextual cues such as excitement and tactical insights, contains enough information to reliably spot key actions in a match. To demonstrate this, we use the SoccerNet Echoes dataset, which provides timestamped commentary, and employ a system of three LLMs acting as judges specializing in outcome, excitement, and tactics. Each LLM evaluates sliding windows of commentary to identify actions like goals, cards, and substitutions, generating accurate timestamps for these events. Our experiments show that this language-centric approach performs effectively in detecting critical match events, providing a lightweight and training-free alternative to traditional video-based methods for action spotting.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.16473v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: As conversational agents increasingly engage in emotionally supportive dialogue, it is important to understand how closely their interactions resemble those in traditional therapy settings. This study investigates whether the concerns shared with a robot align with those shared in human-to-human (H2H) therapy sessions, and whether robot responses semantically mirror those of human therapists. We analyzed two datasets: one of interactions between users and professional therapists (Hugging Face's NLP Mental Health Conversations), and another involving supportive conversations with a social robot (QTrobot from LuxAI) powered by a large language model (LLM, GPT-3.5). Using sentence embeddings and K-means clustering, we assessed cross-agent thematic alignment by applying a distance-based cluster-fitting method that evaluates whether responses from one agent type map to clusters derived from the other, and validated it using Euclidean distances. Results showed that 90.88% of robot conversation disclosures could be mapped to clusters from the human therapy dataset, suggesting shared topical structure. For matched clusters, we compared the subjects as well as therapist and robot responses using Transformer, Word2Vec, and BERT embeddings, revealing strong semantic overlap in subjects' disclosures in both datasets, as well as in the responses given to similar human disclosure themes across agent types (robot vs. human therapist). These findings highlight both the parallels and boundaries of robot-led support conversations and their potential for augmenting mental health interventions.",

However, existing detectors, relying on either audio or lyrics, face key practical limitations: audio-based detectors fail to generalize to new or unseen generators and are vulnerable to audio perturbations; lyrics-based methods require cleanly formatted and accurate lyrics, unavailable in practice. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel, practically grounded approach: a multimodal, modular late-fusion pipeline that combines automatically transcribed sung lyrics and speech features capturing lyrics-related information within the audio.

Lagrangian methods offer a way to blend objectives with constraints, but often require intricate reward engineering and parameter tuning. In this work, we extend recent advances that connect Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equations with RL to propose two novel value functions for dual-objective satisfaction. Namely, we address: (1) the Reach-Always-Avoid problem - of achieving distinct reward and penalty thresholds - and (2) the Reach-Reach problem - of achieving thresholds of two distinct rewards. In contrast with temporal logic approaches, which typically involve representing an automaton, we derive explicit, tractable Bellman forms in this context by decomposing our problem into reach, avoid, and reach-avoid problems, as to leverage these aforementioned recent advances. From a mathematical perspective, the Reach-Always-Avoid and Reach-Reach problems are complementary and fundamentally different from standard sum-of-rewards problems and temporal logic problems, providing a new perspective on constrained decision-making. We leverage our analysis to propose a variation of Proximal Policy Optimization (DO-HJ-PPO), which solves these problems. Across a range of tasks for safe-arrival and multi-target achievement, we demonstrate that DO-HJ-PPO produces qualitatively distinct behaviors from previous approaches and out-competes a number of baselines in various metrics.",

In contrast, segmentation models exhibit errors similar to those seen in intuitive human processing and lack understanding of sub-structures, as indicated by errors related to sub-components in identified instances.

However, this type of optimization requires differentiation, and with recent evidence of the benefits of non-differentiable (e.g. neuromorphic) architectures over classical models w.r.t. efficiency, such constraints can become limiting in the future. We present Layer-wise Feedback Propagation (LFP), a novel training principle for neural network-like predictors that utilizes methods from the domain of explainability to decompose a reward to individual neurons based on their respective contributions. Leveraging these neuron-wise rewards, our method then implements a greedy approach reinforcing helpful parts of the network and weakening harmful ones. While having comparable computational complexity to gradient descent, LFP does not require gradient computation and generates sparse and thereby memory- and energy-efficient parameter updates and models. We establish the convergence of LFP theoretically and empirically, demonstrating its effectiveness on various models and datasets. Via two applications - neural network pruning and the approximation-free training of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) - we demonstrate that LFP combines increased efficiency in terms of computation and representation with flexibility w.r.t. choice of model architecture and objective function.

In this paper, we construct BATCHSAFEBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 150 attack instructions of two types and 8k batch instances, to study the batch prompting vulnerability systematically. Our evaluation of both closed-source and open-weight LLMs demonstrates that all LLMs are susceptible to batch-prompting attacks. We then explore multiple defending approaches.

As we advance towards higher levels of vehicle automation, challenges still exist, as driving with automation can cognitively over-demand drivers if they engage in non-driving-related tasks (NDRTs), or lead to drowsiness if driving was the sole task. This calls for the urgent need for an effective Driver Monitoring System (DMS) that can evaluate cognitive load and drowsiness in SAE Level-2/3 autonomous driving contexts. In this study, we propose a novel multi-task DMS, termed VDMoE, which leverages RGB video input to monitor driver states non-invasively. By utilizing key facial features to minimize computational load and integrating remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) for physiological insights, our approach enhances detection accuracy while maintaining efficiency. Additionally, we optimize the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework to accommodate multi-modal inputs and improve performance across different tasks. A novel prior-inclusive regularization method is introduced to align model outputs with statistical priors, thus accelerating convergence and mitigating overfitting risks. We validate our method with the creation of a new dataset (MCDD), which comprises RGB video and physiological indicators from 42 participants, and two public datasets.

To address these challenges in the retail domain, we propose a deep learning-based approach that automates key-frame identification in retail videos and provides automatic annotations of products and customers.

Experimental results showcase the superiority of our approach over traditional methods, achieving accuracy comparable to human annotator labeling while enhancing the overall efficiency of retail video annotation. Remarkably, our approach leads to an average of 2 times cost savings in video annotation. By allowing human annotators to verify/adjust less than 5% of detected frames in the video dataset, while automating the annotation process for the remaining frames without reducing annotation quality, retailers can significantly reduce operational costs.

Constructing chain-of-thought (CoT) training data is essential for bolstering the reasoning abilities of medical MLLMs. However, existing approaches exhibit a deficiency in offering a comprehensive framework for searching and evaluating effective reasoning paths towards critical diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose Mentor-Intern Collaborative Search (MICS), a novel reasoning-path searching scheme to generate rigorous and effective medical CoT data. MICS first leverages mentor models to initialize the reasoning, one step at a time, then prompts each intern model to continue the thinking along those initiated paths, and finally selects the optimal reasoning path according to the overall reasoning performance of multiple intern models. The reasoning performance is determined by an MICS-Score, which assesses the quality of generated reasoning paths. Eventually, we construct MMRP, a multi-task medical reasoning dataset with ranked difficulty, and Chiron-o1, a new medical MLLM devised via a curriculum learning strategy, with robust visual question-answering and generalizable reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Chiron-o1, trained on our CoT dataset constructed using MICS, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a list of medical visual question answering and reasoning benchmarks.

Constructing chain-of-thought (CoT) training data is essential for bolstering the reasoning abilities of medical MLLMs. However, existing approaches exhibit a deficiency in offering a comprehensive framework for searching and evaluating effective reasoning paths towards critical diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose Mentor-Intern Collaborative Search (MICS), a novel reasoning-path searching scheme to generate rigorous and effective medical CoT data. MICS first leverages mentor models to initialize the reasoning, one step at a time, then prompts each intern model to continue the thinking along those initiated paths, and finally selects the optimal reasoning path according to the overall reasoning performance of multiple intern models. The reasoning performance is determined by an MICS-Score, which assesses the quality of generated reasoning paths. Eventually, we construct MMRP, a multi-task medical reasoning dataset with ranked difficulty, and Chiron-o1, a new medical MLLM devised via a curriculum learning strategy, with robust visual question-answering and generalizable reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Chiron-o1, trained on our CoT dataset constructed using MICS, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a list of medical visual question answering and reasoning benchmarks.

    "description": "arXiv:2506.15707v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using additional inference-time computation to explore multiple reasoning paths through search. Yet how to allocate a fixed rollout budget most effectively during search remains underexplored, often resulting in inefficient use of compute at test time. To bridge this gap, we formulate test-time search as a resource allocation problem and derive the optimal allocation strategy that maximizes the probability of obtaining a correct solution under a fixed rollout budget. Within this formulation, we reveal a core limitation of existing search methods: solution-level allocation tends to favor reasoning directions with more candidates, leading to theoretically suboptimal and inefficient use of compute. To address this, we propose Direction-Oriented Resource Allocation (DORA), a provably optimal method that mitigates this bias by decoupling direction quality from candidate count and allocating resources at the direction level. To demonstrate DORA's effectiveness, we conduct extensive experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks including MATH500, AIME2024, and AIME2025. The empirical results show that DORA consistently outperforms strong baselines with comparable computational cost, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.

In particular, they were hampered by datasets that lacked diversity and failed to address specialized tasks or edge cases. Furthermore, challenges in supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) led to failures in generating precise, human-intent-aligned code. To tackle these challenges and improve the code generation performance for automated programming systems, we propose Feedback-driven Adaptive Long/short-term memory reinforced Coding Optimization (i.e., FALCON). FALCON is structured into two hierarchical levels. From the global level, long-term memory improves code quality by retaining and applying learned knowledge.

Additionally, we introduce meta-reinforcement learning with feedback rewards to solve the global-local bi-level optimization problem and enhance the model's adaptability across diverse code generation tasks.

To address these challenges, we introduce FD-Dataset, a comprehensive bilingual fingerprinting benchmark comprising 90,000 text samples from 20 famous proprietary and open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we present FDLLM, a novel fingerprinting method that leverages parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune a foundation model. This approach enables LoRA to extract deep, persistent features that characterize each source LLM. Through our analysis, we find that LoRA adaptation promotes the aggregation of outputs from the same LLM in representation space while enhancing the separation between different LLMs. This mechanism explains why LoRA proves particularly effective for LLM fingerprinting. Extensive empirical evaluations on FD-Dataset demonstrate FDLLM's superiority, achieving a Macro F1 score 22.1% higher than the strongest baseline.

However, training robust BrainAGE models requires large datasets, often restricted by privacy concerns. This study evaluates the performance of federated learning (FL) for BrainAGE estimation in ischemic stroke patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy, and investigates its association with clinical phenotypes and functional outcomes. $textbf{Methods:}$ We used FLAIR brain images from 1674 stroke patients across 16 hospital centers. We implemented standard machine learning and deep learning models for BrainAGE estimates under three data management strategies: centralized learning (pooled data), FL (local training at each site), and single-site learning. We reported prediction errors and examined associations between BrainAGE and vascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking), as well as functional outcomes at three months post-stroke. Logistic regression evaluated BrainAGE's predictive value for these outcomes, adjusting for age, sex, vascular risk factors, stroke severity, time between MRI and arterial puncture, prior intravenous thrombolysis, and recanalisation outcome. $textbf{Results:}$ While centralized learning yielded the most accurate predictions, FL consistently outperformed single-site models. BrainAGE was significantly higher in patients with diabetes mellitus across all models. Comparisons between patients with good and poor functional outcomes, and multivariate predictions of these outcomes showed the significance of the association between BrainAGE and post-stroke recovery. $textbf{Conclusion:}$ FL enables accurate age predictions without data centralization. The strong association between BrainAGE, vascular risk factors, and post-stroke recovery highlights its potential for prognostic modeling in stroke care.",

This study evaluates the performance of federated learning (FL) for BrainAGE estimation in ischemic stroke patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy, and investigates its association with clinical phenotypes and functional outcomes. $textbf{Methods:}$ We used FLAIR brain images from 1674 stroke patients across 16 hospital centers. We implemented standard machine learning and deep learning models for BrainAGE estimates under three data management strategies: centralized learning (pooled data), FL (local training at each site), and single-site learning. We reported prediction errors and examined associations between BrainAGE and vascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking), as well as functional outcomes at three months post-stroke. Logistic regression evaluated BrainAGE's predictive value for these outcomes, adjusting for age, sex, vascular risk factors, stroke severity, time between MRI and arterial puncture, prior intravenous thrombolysis, and recanalisation outcome. $textbf{Results:}$ While centralized learning yielded the most accurate predictions, FL consistently outperformed single-site models. BrainAGE was significantly higher in patients with diabetes mellitus across all models. Comparisons between patients with good and poor functional outcomes, and multivariate predictions of these outcomes showed the significance of the association between BrainAGE and post-stroke recovery. $textbf{Conclusion:}$ FL enables accurate age predictions without data centralization. The strong association between BrainAGE, vascular risk factors, and post-stroke recovery highlights its potential for prognostic modeling in stroke care.",

To address this, we propose FLAME, a novel federated learning framework based on the Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architecture. Unlike prior approaches, FLAME retains full (uncompressed) global LoRA matrices and achieves client-side adaptability by varying the number of activated experts per client.

Many such time series exhibit multiple regimes, i.e., consecutive temporal segments with a priori unknown boundaries, with each regime having its own causal structure. Inferring causal dependencies and regime shifts is critical for analyzing the underlying processes. However, causal structure learning in this setting is challenging due to (1) non stationarity, i.e., each regime can have its own causal graph and mixing function, and (2) complex noise distributions, which may be non Gaussian or heteroscedastic. Existing causal discovery approaches cannot address these challenges, since generally assume stationarity or Gaussian noise with constant variance. Hence, we introduce FANTOM, a unified framework for causal discovery that handles non stationary processes along with non Gaussian and heteroscedastic noises. FANTOM simultaneously infers the number of regimes and their corresponding indices and learns each regime's Directed Acyclic Graph. It uses a Bayesian Expectation Maximization algorithm that maximizes the evidence lower bound of the data log likelihood. On the theoretical side, we prove, under mild assumptions, that temporal heteroscedastic causal models, introduced in FANTOM's formulation, are identifiable in both stationary and non stationary settings.

This success drives the imperative to interpret their internal mechanisms with the dual goals of enhancing performance and improving behavioral control. Attribution methods help advance interpretability by assigning model outputs associated with a target concept to specific model components. Current attribution research primarily studies multi-layer perceptron neurons and addresses relatively simple concepts such as factual associations (e.g., Paris is located in France). This focus tends to overlook the impact of the attention mechanism and lacks a unified approach for analyzing more complex concepts. To fill these gaps, we introduce Scalable Attention Module Discovery (SAMD), a concept-agnostic method for mapping arbitrary, complex concepts to specific attention heads of general transformer models. We accomplish this by representing each concept as a vector, calculating its cosine similarity with each attention head, and selecting the TopK-scoring heads to construct the concept-associated attention module. We then propose Scalar Attention Module Intervention (SAMI), a simple strategy to diminish or amplify the effects of a concept by adjusting the attention module using only a single scalar parameter. Empirically, we demonstrate SAMD on concepts of varying complexity, and visualize the locations of their corresponding modules. Our results demonstrate that module locations remain stable before and after LLM post-training, and confirm prior work on the mechanics of LLM multilingualism. Through SAMI, we facilitate jailbreaking on HarmBench (+72.7%) by diminishing 'safety' and improve performance on the GSM8K benchmark (+1.6%) by amplifying 'reasoning'.

HippoRAG 2 builds upon the Personalized PageRank algorithm used in HippoRAG and enhances it with deeper passage integration and more effective online use of an LLM. This combination pushes this RAG system closer to the effectiveness of human long-term memory, achieving a 7% improvement in associative memory tasks over the state-of-the-art embedding model while also exhibiting superior factual knowledge and sense-making memory capabilities. This work paves the way for non-parametric continual learning for LLMs. Code and data are available at https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/HippoRAG.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.16563v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Instance segmentation is essential for applications such as automated monitoring of plant health, growth, and yield. However, extensive effort is required to create large-scale datasets with pixel-level annotations of each object instance for developing instance segmentation models that restrict the use of deep learning in these areas. This challenge is more significant in images with densely packed, self-occluded objects, which are common in agriculture. To address this challenge, we propose a semi-self-supervised learning approach that requires minimal manual annotation to develop a high-performing instance segmentation model. We design GLMask, an image-mask representation for the model to focus on shape, texture, and pattern while minimizing its dependence on color features. We develop a pipeline to generate semantic segmentation and then transform it into instance-level segmentation. The proposed approach substantially outperforms the conventional instance segmentation models, establishing a state-of-the-art wheat head instance segmentation model with mAP@50 of 98.5%. Additionally, we assessed the proposed methodology on the general-purpose Microsoft COCO dataset, achieving a significant performance improvement of over 12.6% mAP@50.

We rigorously back-tested three state-of-the-art TSFMs (Chronos, TimeGPT and Moirai) under data-scarce conditions and structural breaks. Our results demonstrate that appropriately engineered TSFMs can internalise rich economic dynamics, accommodate regime shifts, and deliver well-behaved uncertainty estimates out of the box, while matching state-of-the-art multivariate models on this domain. Our findings suggest that, without any fine-tuning, TSFMs can match or exceed classical models during stable economic conditions.

Building on these foundations, we propose a more comprehensive setting, Agent Collaborative-Competitive Adaptation (ACCA), which evaluates an agent to generalize across diverse scenarios, tasks, and interactions with both unfamiliar opponents and teammates.

Additionally, a viewpoint alignment module harmonizes the observational perspectives of retrieved teammates and opponents with the learning agent.

    "title": "GRPO-CARE: Consistency-Aware Reinforcement Learning for Multimodal Reasoning",
    "description": "arXiv:2506.16141v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning approaches, such as outcome-supervised GRPO, have advanced Chain-of-Thought reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet their adaptation to multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) is unexplored. To address the lack of rigorous evaluation for MLLM post-training methods, we introduce SEED-Bench-R1, a benchmark with complex real-world videos requiring balanced perception and reasoning. It offers a large training set and evaluates generalization across three escalating challenges: in-distribution, cross-environment, and cross-environment-task scenarios. Using SEED-Bench-R1, we find that standard GRPO, while improving answer accuracy, often reduces logical coherence between reasoning steps and answers, with only a 57.9% consistency rate. This stems from reward signals focusing solely on final answers, encouraging shortcuts, and strict KL penalties limiting exploration.To address this, we propose GRPO-CARE, a consistency-aware RL framework optimizing both answer correctness and reasoning coherence without explicit supervision. GRPO-CARE introduces a two-tiered reward: (1) a base reward for answer correctness, and (2) an adaptive consistency bonus, computed by comparing the model's reasoning-to-answer likelihood (via a slowly-evolving reference model) against group peers.This dual mechanism amplifies rewards for reasoning paths that are both correct and logically consistent.

    "summary": "arXiv:2506.16141v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning approaches, such as outcome-supervised GRPO, have advanced Chain-of-Thought reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet their adaptation to multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) is unexplored. To address the lack of rigorous evaluation for MLLM post-training methods, we introduce SEED-Bench-R1, a benchmark with complex real-world videos requiring balanced perception and reasoning. It offers a large training set and evaluates generalization across three escalating challenges: in-distribution, cross-environment, and cross-environment-task scenarios. Using SEED-Bench-R1, we find that standard GRPO, while improving answer accuracy, often reduces logical coherence between reasoning steps and answers, with only a 57.9% consistency rate. This stems from reward signals focusing solely on final answers, encouraging shortcuts, and strict KL penalties limiting exploration.To address this, we propose GRPO-CARE, a consistency-aware RL framework optimizing both answer correctness and reasoning coherence without explicit supervision. GRPO-CARE introduces a two-tiered reward: (1) a base reward for answer correctness, and (2) an adaptive consistency bonus, computed by comparing the model's reasoning-to-answer likelihood (via a slowly-evolving reference model) against group peers.This dual mechanism amplifies rewards for reasoning paths that are both correct and logically consistent. Replacing KL penalties with this adaptive bonus, GRPO-CARE outperforms standard GRPO on SEED-Bench-R1, achieving a 6.7% performance gain on the hardest evaluation level and a 24.5% improvement in consistency. It also shows strong transferability, improving model performance across diverse video understanding benchmarks.

However, prior works on non-prehensile manipulation cannot yet generalize across environments with diverse geometries. The main challenge lies in adapting to varying environmental constraints: within a cabinet, the robot must avoid walls and ceilings; to lift objects to the top of a step, the robot must account for the step's pose and extent. While deep reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated impressive success in non-prehensile manipulation, accounting for such variability presents a challenge for the generalist policy, as it must learn diverse strategies for each new combination of constraints. To address this, we propose a modular and reconfigurable architecture that adaptively reconfigures network modules based on task requirements. To capture the geometric variability in environments, we extend the contact-based object representation (CORN) to environment geometries, and propose a procedural algorithm for generating diverse environments to train our agent. Taken together, the resulting policy can zero-shot transfer to novel real-world environments and objects despite training entirely within a simulator.

While this setup is generally believed to produce more capable models, current literature does not provide any insights into its design choices. This study closes this gap by systematically investigating how different synthetic captioning strategies impact the downstream performance of text-to-image models. Our experiments demonstrate that dense, high-quality captions enhance text alignment but may introduce trade-offs in output aesthetics and diversity. Conversely, captions of randomized lengths yield balanced improvements across aesthetics and alignment without compromising sample diversity.

Its effectiveness is shown across multiple datasets, architectures, and when augmenting established AT methods. Our findings underscore the impact of feature pre-conditioning via standard training for developing more efficient, principled robust defenses. Code is available in the supplementary material.",

This attribute can be measured by joint predictions, which are particularly important for combinatorial and sequential decision problems. In this research, we integrate epistemic neural networks (ENN) with the conventional architecture of GFlowNets to enable more efficient joint predictions and better uncertainty quantification, thereby improving exploration and the identification of optimal trajectories.

    "description": "arXiv:2506.16731v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Federated learning (FL) provides a promising paradigm for facilitating collaboration between multiple clients that jointly learn a global model without directly sharing their local data. However, existing research suffers from two caveats: 1) From the perspective of agents, voluntary and unselfish participation is often assumed. But self-interested agents may opt out of the system or provide low-quality contributions without proper incentives; 2) From the mechanism designer's perspective, the aggregated models can be unsatisfactory as the existing game-theoretical federated learning approach for data collection ignores the potential heterogeneous effort caused by contributed data. To alleviate above challenges, we propose an incentive-aware framework for agent participation that considers data heterogeneity to accelerate the convergence process. Specifically, we first introduce the notion of Wasserstein distance to explicitly illustrate the heterogeneous effort and reformulate the existing upper bound of convergence. To induce truthful reporting from agents, we analyze and measure the generalization error gap of any two agents by leveraging the peer prediction mechanism to develop score functions. We further present a two-stage Stackelberg game model that formalizes the process and examines the existence of equilibrium. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism.",

For real-world datasets like ImageNet-1K, Info-Coevolution reduces annotation and training costs by 32% without performance loss.

For example, OpenAI's Operator can use a web browser to do product comparisons and buy online goods. Much research on making agents useful and safe focuses on directly modifying their behaviour, such as by training them to follow user instructions. Direct behavioural modifications are useful, but do not fully address how heterogeneous agents will interact with each other and other actors. Rather, we will need external protocols and systems to shape such interactions. For instance, agents will need more efficient protocols to communicate with each other and form agreements.

Given this motivation, we propose the concept of textbf{agent infrastructure}: technical systems and shared protocols external to agents that are designed to mediate and influence their interactions with and impacts on their environments. Just as the Internet relies on protocols like HTTPS, our work argues that agent infrastructure will be similarly indispensable to ecosystems of agents. We identify three functions for agent infrastructure: 1) attributing actions, properties, and other information to specific agents, their users, or other actors; 2) shaping agents' interactions; and 3) detecting and remedying harmful actions from agents.

Due to the lack of advanced sensor and network technologies on majority of farms, there are challenges in obtaining comprehensive and diverse agricultural data.

This research proposes a knowledge-guided graph neural network framework that addresses the above challenges by integrating knowledge embedded in an agricultural process-based model and graph neural network techniques.

However, there is limited understanding of how LLM serving benefits from KV$ caching, where system design decisions like cache eviction policies are highly workload-dependent. In this paper, we present the first systematic characterization of the KV$ workload patterns from one of the leading LLM service providers. We draw observations that were not covered by previous studies focusing on synthetic workloads, including: KV$ reuses are skewed across requests, where reuses between single-turn requests are equally important as multi-turn requests; the reuse time and probability are diverse considering all requests, but for a specific request category, the pattern tends to be predictable; and the overall cache size required for an ideal cache hit ratio is moderate. Based on the characterization, we further propose a workload-aware cache eviction policy that improves the serving performance under real-world traces, especially with limited cache capacity.",

To overcome these limitations, we propose a Latent Noise Injection method using Masked Autoregressive Flows (MAF).

Sparse attention mechanisms alleviate this issue by computing attention weights only for selected key-value pairs. However, their indexing computation typically requires traversing all key vectors, resulting in significant computational and data transfer overhead. To reduce the cost of index retrieval, existing methods often treat each decoding step as an independent process, failing to exploit the temporal correlations embedded in historical decoding information. To this end, we propose LFPS(Learn From the Past for Sparse Indexing), an acceleration method that dynamically constructs sparse indexing candidates based on historical attention patterns. LFPS captures two prevalent trends in decoder attention -vertical patterns (attending to fixed positions) and slash patterns (attending to relative positions) -and incorporates a positional expansion strategy to effectively predict the Top-k indices for the current step. We validate LFPS on challenging long-context benchmarks such as LongBench-RULER, using Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct as the base model. Experimental results show that LFPS achieves up to 22.8$times$ speedup over full attention and 9.6$times$ speedup over exact Top-k retrieval on an RTX 4090 GPU and a single CPU core of a Xeon Gold 6430, respectively, while preserving generation accuracy.

We validate LFPS on challenging long-context benchmarks such as LongBench-RULER, using Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct as the base model. Experimental results show that LFPS achieves up to 22.8$times$ speedup over full attention and 9.6$times$ speedup over exact Top-k retrieval on an RTX 4090 GPU and a single CPU core of a Xeon Gold 6430, respectively, while preserving generation accuracy. These results demonstrate that LFPS offers a practical and efficient solution for decoding optimization in long-context LLM inference.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.11480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key technique for enhancing LLMs' reasoning abilities, yet its data inefficiency remains a major bottleneck. To address this critical yet challenging issue, we present a novel gradient-alignment-based method, named LearnAlign, which intelligently selects the learnable and representative training reasoning data for RL post-training. To overcome the issue of response-length bias in gradient norms, we introduce the data learnability based on the success rate, which can indicate the learning potential of each data point. Experiments across three mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly reduces training data requirements while achieving minor performance degradation or even improving performance compared to full-data training. For example, it reduces data requirements by up to 1,000 data points with better performance (77.53%) than that on the full dataset on GSM8K benchmark (77.04%). Furthermore, we show its effectiveness in the staged RL setting. This work provides valuable insights into data-efficient RL post-training and establishes a foundation for future research in optimizing reasoning data selection. To facilitate future work, we will release code.",

To deploy robots in collaborative setting, like houses, being able to receive and handing over objects safely and efficiently becomes a crucial skill. In this work, we demonstrate the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for dexterous object handover between two multi-finger hands. Key to this task is the use of a novel reward function based on dual quaternions to minimize the rotation distance, which outperforms other rotation representations such as Euler and rotation matrices. The robustness of the trained policy is experimentally evaluated by testing w.r.t. objects that are not included in the training distribution, and perturbations during the handover process. The results demonstrate that the trained policy successfully perform this task, achieving a total success rate of 94% in the best-case scenario after 100 experiments, thereby showing the robustness of our policy with novel objects. In addition, the best-case performance of the policy decreases by only 13.8% when the other robot moves during the handover, proving that our policy is also robust to this type of perturbation, which is common in real-world object handovers.",

Each interaction technique exhibits its own strength, and solely using one type usually constrains the model's capability to capture the complex feature relationships, especially for industrial data with enormous input feature fields. Recent research shows that effective CTR models often combine an MLP network with a dedicated feature interaction network in a two-parallel structure. However, the interplay and cooperative dynamics between different streams or branches remain under-researched. In this work, we introduce a novel Multi-Branch Cooperation Network (MBCnet) which enables multiple branch networks to collaborate with each other for better complex feature interaction modeling. Specifically, MBCnet consists of three branches: the Extensible Feature Grouping and Crossing (EFGC) branch that promotes the model's memorization ability of specific feature fields, the low rank Cross Net branch and Deep branch to enhance explicit and implicit feature crossing for improved generalization. Among these branches, a novel cooperation scheme is proposed based on two principles: Branch co-teaching and moderate differentiation. Branch co-teaching encourages well-learned branches to support poorly-learned ones on specific training samples. Moderate differentiation advocates branches to maintain a reasonable level of difference in their feature representations on the same inputs. This cooperation strategy improves learning through mutual knowledge sharing and boosts the discovery of diverse feature interactions across branches. Experiments on large-scale industrial datasets and online A/B test at Taobao app demonstrate MBCnet's superior performance, delivering a 0.09 point increase in CTR, 1.49% growth in deals, and 1.62% rise in GMV.

    "description": "arXiv:2506.15758v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We introduce CIfly, a framework for efficient algorithmic primitives in graphical causal inference that isolates reachability as a reusable core operation. It builds on the insight that many causal reasoning tasks can be reduced to reachability in purpose-built state-space graphs that can be constructed on the fly during traversal. We formalize a rule table schema for specifying such algorithms and prove they run in linear time. We establish CIfly as a more efficient alternative to the common primitives moralization and latent projection, which we show are computationally equivalent to Boolean matrix multiplication.

    "summary": "arXiv:2506.15758v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We introduce CIfly, a framework for efficient algorithmic primitives in graphical causal inference that isolates reachability as a reusable core operation. It builds on the insight that many causal reasoning tasks can be reduced to reachability in purpose-built state-space graphs that can be constructed on the fly during traversal. We formalize a rule table schema for specifying such algorithms and prove they run in linear time. We establish CIfly as a more efficient alternative to the common primitives moralization and latent projection, which we show are computationally equivalent to Boolean matrix multiplication.

    "description": "arXiv:2506.15793v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: A computational bottleneck in current Vector-Symbolic Architectures (VSAs) is the ``clean-up'' step, which decodes the noisy vectors retrieved from the architecture. Clean-up typically compares noisy vectors against a ``codebook'' of prototype vectors, incurring computational complexity that is quadratic or similar. We present a new codebook representation that supports efficient clean-up, based on Kroneker products of rotation-like matrices. The resulting clean-up time complexity is linearithmic, i.e. $mathcal{O}(N,text{log},N)$, where $N$ is the vector dimension and also the number of vectors in the codebook. Clean-up space complexity is $mathcal{O}(N)$. Furthermore, the codebook is not stored explicitly in computer memory: It can be represented in $mathcal{O}(text{log},N)$ space, and individual vectors in the codebook can be materialized in $mathcal{O}(N)$ time and space. At the same time, asymptotic memory capacity remains comparable to standard approaches. Computer experiments confirm these results, demonstrating several orders of magnitude more scalability than baseline VSA techniques.",

Recent speech tokenization approaches aim to isolate semantic information from low-level acoustics to better align with language models. In particular, previous methods use SSL teachers such as HuBERT to extract semantic representations, which are then distilled into a semantic quantizer to suppress acoustic redundancy as well as capture content-related latent structures. However, they still produce speech token sequences significantly longer than their textual counterparts, creating challenges for efficient speech-language modeling. Reducing the frame rate is a natural solution, but standard techniques, such as rigid average pooling across frames, can distort or dilute the semantic structure required for effective LM alignment. To address this, we propose LM-SPT, a speech tokenization method that introduces a novel semantic distillation. Instead of directly matching teacher and student features via pooling, we reconstruct speech solely from semantic tokens and minimize the discrepancy between the encoded representations of the original and reconstructed waveforms, obtained from a frozen automatic speech recognition (ASR) encoder. This indirect yet data-driven supervision enables the tokenizer to learn discrete units that are more semantically aligned with language models. LM-SPT further incorporates architectural improvements to the encoder and decoder for speech tokenization, and supports multiple frame rates, including 25Hz, 12.5Hz, and 6.25Hz.

Furthermore, we introduce Adaptive-Scalable Entmax (ASEntmax), which endows $alpha$-entmax with a learnable temperature parameter, allowing the attention distribution to interpolate between sparse (pattern-focused) and dense (softmax-like) regimes. Finally, we show that the ability to locate and generalize fixed-size patterns can be further improved through a careful design of position encodings, which impacts both dense and sparse attention methods.

    "summary": "arXiv:2506.17213v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: An ideal traffic simulator replicates the realistic long-term point-to-point trip that a self-driving system experiences during deployment. Prior models and benchmarks focus on closed-loop motion simulation for initial agents in a scene. This is problematic for long-term simulation. Agents enter and exit the scene as the ego vehicle enters new regions. We propose InfGen, a unified next-token prediction model that performs interleaved closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation. InfGen automatically switches between closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation mode. It enables stable long-term rollout simulation.

    "description": "arXiv:2506.16819v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The proliferation of generative models has raised serious concerns about visual content forgery. Existing deepfake detection methods primarily target either image-level classification or pixel-wise localization. While some achieve high accuracy, they often suffer from limited generalization across manipulation types or rely on complex architectures. In this paper, we propose Loupe, a lightweight yet effective framework for joint deepfake detection and localization. Loupe integrates a patch-aware classifier and a segmentation module with conditional queries, allowing simultaneous global authenticity classification and fine-grained mask prediction. To enhance robustness against distribution shifts of test set, Loupe introduces a pseudo-label-guided test-time adaptation mechanism by leveraging patch-level predictions to supervise the segmentation head. Extensive experiments on the DDL dataset demonstrate that Loupe achieves state-of-the-art performance, securing the first place in the IJCAI 2025 Deepfake Detection and Localization Challenge with an overall score of 0.846. Our results validate the effectiveness of the proposed patch-level fusion and conditional query design in improving both classification accuracy and spatial localization under diverse forgery patterns.

Many methods operate on the frequency-domain, relying on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) which assumes uniform sampling, therefore requiring prior interpolation that can distort the spectra. To address this limitation, we introduce a differentiable Lomb--Scargle layer that enables a reliable computation of the power spectrum of irregularly sampled data. We integrate this layer into a novel score-based diffusion model (LSCD) for time series imputation conditioned on the entire signal spectrum. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method recovers missing data more accurately than purely time-domain baselines, while simultaneously producing consistent frequency estimates.

Inspired by the way humans reason with mental imagery-the internal construction and manipulation of visual cues-we investigate whether VLMs can reason through interleaved multimodal trajectories without producing explicit images. To this end, we present a Machine Mental Imagery framework, dubbed as Mirage, which augments VLM decoding with latent visual tokens alongside ordinary text. Concretely, whenever the model chooses to ``think visually'', it recasts its hidden states as next tokens, thereby continuing a multimodal trajectory without generating pixel-level images.

Most existing methods utilize powerful pre-trained models to transfer visual/linguistic knowledge by full fine-tuning. However, full fine-tuning the entire backbone not only breaks the rich prior knowledge embedded in the pre-training, but also incurs significant computational costs. Motivated by the recent emergence of Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) methods, we aim to solve the REC task in an effective and efficient manner. Directly applying these PETL methods to the REC task is inappropriate, as they lack the specific-domain abilities for precise local visual perception and visual-language alignment. Therefore, we propose a novel framework of Multimodal Prior-guided Parameter Efficient Tuning, namely MaPPER.

Moreover, the Prior-Guided Text module is proposed to further utilize the prior for facilitating the cross-modal alignment.

While normalization techniques like Batch Normalization and Layer Normalization are standard remedies in deep learning, they disrupt the pointwise input-output mappings critical to preserving the physical consistency in PINNs. In this work, we introduce Mask-PINNs, a novel architecture that regulates internal feature distributions through a smooth, learnable mask function applied pointwise across hidden layers. Unlike conventional normalization methods, the proposed mask function preserves the deterministic nature of input-output relationships while suppressing activation drift and saturation. Theoretically, we demonstrate that Mask-PINNs control feature spread near initialization by attenuating gradient variance growth through a tailored modulation mechanism. Empirically, we validate the method on multiple PDE benchmarks across diverse activation functions. Our results show consistent improvements in prediction accuracy, convergence stability, and robustness, with relative L2 errors reduced by up to two orders of magnitude over baseline models.

We propose a formal framework for evaluating whether an LLM exhibits a sufficiently robust world model, defined as producing consistent outputs across semantically equivalent prompts while distinguishing between prompts that express different intents. We introduce a new evaluation approach to measure this that decomposes model response variability into three components: variability due to user purpose, user articulation, and model instability. An LLM with a strong world model should attribute most of the variability in its responses to changes in foundational purpose rather than superficial changes in articulation. This approach allows us to quantify how much of a model's behavior is semantically grounded rather than driven by model instability or alternative wording. We apply this framework to evaluate LLMs across diverse domains. Our results show how larger models attribute a greater share of output variability to changes in user purpose, indicating a more robust world model. This improvement is not uniform, however: larger models do not consistently outperform smaller ones across all domains, and their advantage in robustness is often modest.

These findings highlight the importance of moving beyond accuracy-based benchmarks toward semantic diagnostics that more directly assess the structure and stability of a model's internal understanding of the world.",

Despite this variety, a unified framework for delivering high-quality medical QA has yet to emerge. Although recent progress in reasoning-augmented large language models (LLMs) has shown promise, their ability to achieve comprehensive medical understanding is still largely unexplored. In this paper, we present Med-U1, a unified framework for robust reasoning across medical QA tasks with diverse output formats, ranging from MCQs to complex generation and computation tasks. Med-U1 employs pure large-scale reinforcement learning with mixed rule-based binary reward functions, incorporating a length penalty to manage output verbosity. With multi-objective reward optimization, Med-U1 directs LLMs to produce concise and verifiable reasoning chains. Empirical results reveal that Med-U1 significantly improves performance across multiple challenging Med-QA benchmarks, surpassing even larger specialized and proprietary models. Furthermore, Med-U1 demonstrates robust generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks.

However, for adaptation in clinical practice, their lack of robustness to varying conditions such as staining, scanner, hospital, and demographics is still a limiting factor: if trained on overrepresented subpopulations, models regularly struggle with less frequent patterns, leading to shortcut learning and biased predictions. Large-scale foundation models have not fully eliminated this issue. Therefore, we propose a novel approach explicitly modeling such metadata into a Metadata-guided generative Diffusion model framework (MeDi). MeDi allows for a targeted augmentation of underrepresented subpopulations with synthetic data, which balances limited training data and mitigates biases in downstream models. We experimentally show that MeDi generates high-quality histopathology images for unseen subpopulations in TCGA, boosts the overall fidelity of the generated images, and enables improvements in performance for downstream classifiers on datasets with subpopulation shifts.

Yet, most LLM systems rely on full-context prompting, appending all past turns regardless of their relevance. This leads to unbounded memory growth, increased computational costs, and degraded reasoning performance on out-of-distribution input lengths. We introduce MEM1, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that enables agents to operate with constant memory across long multi-turn tasks. At each turn, MEM1 updates a compact shared internal state that jointly supports memory consolidation and reasoning. This state integrates prior memory with new observations from the environment while strategically discarding irrelevant or redundant information. To support training in more realistic and compositional settings, we propose a simple yet effective and scalable approach to constructing multi-turn environments by composing existing datasets into arbitrarily complex task sequences. Experiments across three domains, including internal retrieval QA, open-domain web QA, and multi-turn web shopping, show that MEM1-7B improves performance by 3.5x while reducing memory usage by 3.7x compared to Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct on a 16-objective multi-hop QA task, and generalizes beyond the training horizon.

    "description": "arXiv:2506.16754v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The hyperbolic space, characterized by a constant negative curvature and exponentially expanding space, aligns well with the structural properties of heterogeneous graphs. However, although heterogeneous graphs inherently possess diverse power-law structures, most hyperbolic heterogeneous graph embedding models rely on a single hyperbolic space. This approach may fail to effectively capture the diverse power-law structures within heterogeneous graphs. To address this limitation, we propose a Metapath-based Hyperbolic Contrastive Learning framework (MHCL), which uses multiple hyperbolic spaces to capture diverse complex structures within heterogeneous graphs. Specifically, by learning each hyperbolic space to describe the distribution of complex structures corresponding to each metapath, it is possible to capture semantic information effectively. Since metapath embeddings represent distinct semantic information, preserving their discriminability is important when aggregating them to obtain node representations. Therefore, we use a contrastive learning approach to optimize MHCL and improve the discriminability of metapath embeddings. In particular, our contrastive learning method minimizes the distance between embeddings of the same metapath and maximizes the distance between those of different metapaths in hyperbolic space, thereby improving the separability of metapath embeddings with distinct semantic information. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of MHCL.

We further develop NLP models that predict public perception scores with a strong performance. Leveraging the dataset and model, we examine public perception of science from two perspectives: (1) Perception as an outcome: What factors affect the public perception of scientific information? (2) Perception as a predictor: Can we use the estimated perceptions to predict public engagement with science? We find that individuals' frequency of science news consumption is the driver of perception, whereas demographic factors exert minimal influence. More importantly, through a large-scale analysis and carefully designed natural experiment on Reddit, we demonstrate that the estimated public perception of scientific information has direct connections with the final engagement pattern.

    "description": "arXiv:2501.09481v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Inferring object 3D position and orientation from a single RGB camera is a foundational task in computer vision with many important applications. Traditionally, 3D object detection methods are trained in a fully-supervised setup, requiring LiDAR and vast amounts of human annotations, which are laborious, costly, and do not scale well with the ever-increasing amounts of data being captured. We present a novel method to train a 3D object detector from a single RGB camera without domain-specific human annotations, making orders of magnitude more data available for training. The method uses newly proposed Local Object Motion Model to disentangle object movement source between subsequent frames, is approximately 700 times faster than previous work and compensates camera focal length differences to aggregate multiple datasets. The method is evaluated on three public datasets, where despite using no human labels, it outperforms prior work by a significant margin. It also shows its versatility as a pre-training tool for fully-supervised training and shows that combining pseudo-labels from multiple datasets can achieve comparable accuracy to using human labels from a single dataset.

    "description": "arXiv:2506.15862v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) is powerful, but its effectiveness hinges on which retrievers we use and how. Different retrievers offer distinct, often complementary signals: BM25 captures lexical matches; dense retrievers, semantic similarity. Yet in practice, we typically fix a single retriever based on heuristics, which fails to generalize across diverse information needs. Can we dynamically select and integrate multiple retrievers for each individual query, without the need for manual selection? In our work, we validate this intuition with quantitative analysis and introduce mixture of retrievers: a zero-shot, weighted combination of heterogeneous retrievers. Extensive experiments show that such mixtures are effective and efficient: Despite totaling just 0.8B parameters, this mixture outperforms every individual retriever and even larger 7B models by +10.8% and +3.9% on average, respectively. Further analysis also shows that this mixture framework can help incorporate specialized non-oracle human information sources as retrievers to achieve good collaboration, with a 58.9% relative performance improvement over simulated humans alone.",

Attention analysis shows that longer reasoning chains lead to reduced focus on visual inputs, which contributes to hallucination. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce RH-AUC, a metric that quantifies how a model's perception accuracy changes with reasoning length, allowing us to evaluate whether the model preserves visual grounding during reasoning.

Experimental results demonstrate that RLIF can boost the reasoning performance of base LLMs at the beginning phase of the training, matching or surpassing RLVR techniques on these tasks.

In this work, we propose a novel off-policy method that eliminates the need for additional environmental interactions by reformulating adversarial learning as a soft-constrained optimization problem.

Historical reasoning poses unique challenges for AI, involving multimodal source interpretation, temporal inference, and cross-linguistic analysis. While general-purpose agents perform well on many existing benchmarks, they lack the domain-specific expertise required to engage with historical materials and questions. To address this gap, we introduce HistBench, a new benchmark of 414 high-quality questions designed to evaluate AI's capacity for historical reasoning and authored by more than 40 expert contributors. The tasks span a wide range of historical problems-from factual retrieval based on primary sources to interpretive analysis of manuscripts and images, to interdisciplinary challenges involving archaeology, linguistics, or cultural history. Furthermore, the benchmark dataset spans 29 ancient and modern languages and covers a wide range of historical periods and world regions. Finding the poor performance of LLMs and other agents on HistBench, we further present HistAgent, a history-specific agent equipped with carefully designed tools for OCR, translation, archival search, and image understanding in History. On HistBench, HistAgent based on GPT-4o achieves an accuracy of 27.54% pass@1 and 36.47% pass@2, significantly outperforming LLMs with online search and generalist agents, including GPT-4o (18.60%), DeepSeek-R1(14.49%) and Open Deep Research-smolagents(20.29% pass@1 and 25.12% pass@2).

    "description": "arXiv:2411.09642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Specifying all desirable properties of a language model is challenging, but certain requirements seem essential. Given samples from an unknown language, the trained model should produce valid strings not seen in training and be expressive enough to capture the language's full richness. Otherwise, outputting invalid strings constitutes 'hallucination,' and failing to capture the full range leads to 'mode collapse.' We ask if a language model can meet both requirements. We investigate this within a statistical language generation setting building on Gold and Angluin. Here, the model receives random samples from a distribution over an unknown language K, which belongs to a possibly infinite collection of languages. The goal is to generate unseen strings from K. We say the model generates from K with consistency and breadth if, as training size increases, its output converges to all unseen strings in K. Kleinberg and Mullainathan [KM24] asked if consistency and breadth in language generation are possible. We answer this negatively: for a large class of language models, including next-token prediction models, this is impossible for most collections of candidate languages. This contrasts with [KM24]'s result, showing consistent generation without breadth is possible for any countable collection of languages. Our finding highlights that generation with breadth fundamentally differs from generation without breadth. As a byproduct, we establish near-tight bounds on the number of samples needed for generation with or without breadth. Finally, our results offer hope: consistent generation with breadth is achievable for any countable collection of languages when negative examples (strings outside K) are available alongside positive ones. This suggests that post-training feedback, which encodes negative examples, can be crucial in reducing hallucinations while limiting mode collapse.",

Researchers have developed more and more powerful test-time derandomization schemes to enhance the empirical performance and the theoretical guarantee of UCO methods.

We show that conformal prediction attains some robustness even with a forward pass on a single randomly perturbed input. Using any binary certificate we propose a single sample robust CP (RCP1).

Existing SD-based Real-VSR methods often compromise spatial details for temporal coherence, resulting in suboptimal visual quality. We argue that the key lies in how to effectively extract the degradation-robust temporal consistency priors from the low-quality (LQ) input video and enhance the video details while maintaining the extracted consistency priors. To achieve this, we propose a Dual LoRA Learning (DLoRAL) paradigm to train an effective SD-based one-step diffusion model, achieving realistic frame details and temporal consistency simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module to aggregate complementary information across frames, and train a Consistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) to learn robust temporal representations from degraded inputs. After consistency learning, we fix the CFR and C-LoRA modules and train a Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) to enhance spatial details while aligning with the temporal space defined by C-LoRA to keep temporal coherence. The two phases alternate iteratively for optimization, collaboratively delivering consistent and detail-rich outputs. During inference, the two LoRA branches are merged into the SD model, allowing efficient and high-quality video restoration in a single diffusion step.

Those labelled training data provide crucial prior knowledge about abnormalities for GAD models, enabling substantially reduced detection errors. However, current supervised GAD methods tend to over-emphasise fitting the seen anomalies, leading to many errors of detecting the unseen anomalies as normal nodes. Further, existing open-set AD models were introduced to handle Euclidean data, failing to effectively capture discriminative features from graph structure and node attributes for GAD. In this work, we propose a novel open-set GAD approach, namely normal structure regularisation (NSReg), to achieve generalised detection ability to unseen anomalies, while maintaining its effectiveness on detecting seen anomalies. The key idea in NSReg is to introduce a regularisation term that enforces the learning of compact, semantically-rich representations of normal nodes based on their structural relations to other nodes. When being optimised with supervised anomaly detection losses, the regularisation term helps incorporate strong normality into the modelling, and thus, it effectively avoids over-fitting the seen anomalies and learns a better normality decision boundary, largely reducing the false negatives of detecting unseen anomalies as normal. Extensive empirical results on seven real-world datasets show that NSReg significantly outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods by at least 14% AUC-ROC on the unseen anomaly classes and by 10% AUC-ROC on all anomaly classes.",

State-of-the-art systems have focused solely on improving accuracy on leading benchmarks. However, these systems are practically unusable due to extremely high end-to-end latency (e.g., tens of minutes) for tasks that typically take humans just a few minutes to complete. To understand the cause behind this and to guide future developments of computer agents, we conduct the first study on the temporal performance of computer-use agents on OSWorld, the flagship benchmark in computer-use AI. We find that large model calls for planning and reflection account for the majority of the overall latency, and as an agent uses more steps to complete a task, each successive step can take 3x longer than steps at the beginning of a task. We then construct OSWorld-Human, a manually annotated version of the original OSWorld dataset that contains a human-determined trajectory for each task. We evaluate 16 agents on their efficiency using OSWorld-Human and found that even the highest-scoring agents on OSWorld take 1.4-2.7x more steps than necessary.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.16856v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Autonomous parking plays a vital role in intelligent vehicle systems, particularly in constrained urban environments where high-precision control is required. While traditional rule-based parking systems struggle with environmental uncertainties and lack adaptability in crowded or dynamic scenes, human drivers demonstrate the ability to park intuitively without explicit modeling. Inspired by this observation, we propose a Transformer-based end-to-end framework for autonomous parking that learns from expert demonstrations. The network takes as input surround-view camera images, goal-point representations, ego vehicle motion, and pedestrian trajectories. It outputs discrete control sequences including throttle, braking, steering, and gear selection. A novel cross-attention module integrates BEV features with target points, and a GRU-based pedestrian predictor enhances safety by modeling dynamic obstacles. We validate our method on the CARLA 0.9.14 simulator in both vertical and parallel parking scenarios. Experiments show our model achieves a high success rate of 96.57%, with average positional and orientation errors of 0.21 meters and 0.41 degrees, respectively. The ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of key modules such as pedestrian prediction and goal-point attention fusion.

Part$^{2}$GS leverages a part-aware 3D Gaussian representation that encodes articulated components with learnable attributes, enabling structured, disentangled transformations that preserve high-fidelity geometry. To ensure physically consistent motion, we propose a motion-aware canonical representation guided by physics-based constraints, including contact enforcement, velocity consistency, and vector-field alignment. Furthermore, we introduce a field of repel points to prevent part collisions and maintain stable articulation paths, significantly improving motion coherence over baselines.

However, we argue that alignment on an individual level can boost the subjective predictive performance for the individual user interacting with the system considerably. Since perception differs for each person, the same situation is observed differently. Consequently, the basis for decision making and the subsequent reasoning processes and observable reactions differ. We hypothesize that individual perception patterns can be used for improving the alignment on an individual level.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm to address these issues, but it also introduces new vulnerabilities. Recent efforts have focused on the security of RAG-based LLMs, yet existing attack methods face three critical challenges: (1) their effectiveness declines sharply when only a limited number of poisoned texts can be injected into the knowledge database, (2) they lack sufficient stealth, as the attacks are often detectable by anomaly detection systems, which compromises their effectiveness, and (3) they rely on heuristic approaches to generate poisoned texts, lacking formal optimization frameworks and theoretic guarantees, which limits their effectiveness and applicability. To address these issues, we propose coordinated Prompt-RAG attack (PR-attack), a novel optimization-driven attack that introduces a small number of poisoned texts into the knowledge database while embedding a backdoor trigger within the prompt. When activated, the trigger causes the LLM to generate pre-designed responses to targeted queries, while maintaining normal behavior in other contexts. This ensures both high effectiveness and stealth. We formulate the attack generation process as a bilevel optimization problem leveraging a principled optimization framework to develop optimal poisoned texts and triggers.

Using structured crime scenarios adapted from classic films, we evaluate both criminal potential and anti-crime ability of LLMs via role-play. Results show that state-of-the-art LLMs frequently exhibit emergent criminal tendencies, such as proposing misleading statements or evasion tactics, even without explicit instructions. Moreover, when placed in a detective role, models recognize deceptive behavior with only 41% accuracy on average, revealing a striking mismatch between conducting and detecting criminal behavior.

Results show that state-of-the-art LLMs frequently exhibit emergent criminal tendencies, such as proposing misleading statements or evasion tactics, even without explicit instructions. Moreover, when placed in a detective role, models recognize deceptive behavior with only 41% accuracy on average, revealing a striking mismatch between conducting and detecting criminal behavior. These findings underscore the urgent need for adversarial robustness, behavioral alignment, and safety mechanisms before broader LLM deployment.",

    "title": "Probing the Robustness of Large Language Models Safety to Latent Perturbations",
    "description": "arXiv:2506.16078v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Safety alignment is a key requirement for building reliable Artificial General Intelligence. Despite significant advances in safety alignment, we observe that minor latent shifts can still trigger unsafe responses in aligned models. We argue that this stems from the shallow nature of existing alignment methods, which focus on surface-level refusal behaviors without sufficiently altering internal representations. Consequently, small shifts in hidden activations can re-trigger harmful behaviors embedded in the latent space. To explore the robustness of safety alignment to latent perturbations, we introduce a probing method that measures the Negative Log-Likelihood of the original response generated by the model. This probe quantifies local sensitivity in the latent space, serving as a diagnostic tool for identifying vulnerable directions. Based on this signal, we construct effective jailbreak trajectories, giving rise to the Activation Steering Attack (ASA). More importantly, these insights offer a principled foundation for improving alignment robustness. To this end, we introduce Layer-wise Adversarial Patch Training~(LAPT), a fine-tuning strategy that inject controlled perturbations into hidden representations during training. Experimental results highlight that LAPT strengthen alignment robustness without compromising general capabilities. Our findings reveal fundamental flaws in current alignment paradigms and call for representation-level training strategies that move beyond surface-level behavior supervision.

    "description": "arXiv:2506.16471v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Sampling efficiently from a target unnormalized probability density remains a core challenge, with relevance across countless high-impact scientific applications. A promising approach towards this challenge is the design of amortized samplers that borrow key ideas, such as probability path design, from state-of-the-art generative diffusion models. However, all existing diffusion-based samplers remain unable to draw samples from distributions at the scale of even simple molecular systems. In this paper, we propose Progressive Inference-Time Annealing (PITA), a novel framework to learn diffusion-based samplers that combines two complementary interpolation techniques: I.) Annealing of the Boltzmann distribution and II.) Diffusion smoothing. PITA trains a sequence of diffusion models from high to low temperatures by sequentially training each model at progressively higher temperatures, leveraging engineered easy access to samples of the temperature-annealed target density. In the subsequent step, PITA enables simulating the trained diffusion model to procure training samples at a lower temperature for the next diffusion model through inference-time annealing using a novel Feynman-Kac PDE combined with Sequential Monte Carlo. Empirically, PITA enables, for the first time, equilibrium sampling of N-body particle systems, Alanine Dipeptide, and tripeptides in Cartesian coordinates with dramatically lower energy function evaluations.

Continual learning (CL) offers a solution by enabling the model to incrementally update without full re-training. Existing CL solutions in document retrieval rely on memory buffers or generative models for rehearsal, which is infeasible when accessing previous training data is restricted due to privacy concerns. To this end, we introduce PromptDSI, a prompt-based, rehearsal-free continual learning approach for document retrieval. PromptDSI follows the Prompt-based Continual Learning (PCL) framework, using learnable prompts to efficiently index new documents without accessing previous documents or queries. To improve retrieval latency, we remove the initial forward pass of PCL, which otherwise greatly increases training and inference time, with a negligible trade-off in performance. Additionally, we introduce a novel topic-aware prompt pool that employs neural topic embeddings as fixed keys, eliminating the instability of prompt key optimization while maintaining competitive performance with existing PCL prompt pools. In a challenging rehearsal-free continual learning setup, we demonstrate that PromptDSI variants outperform rehearsal-based baselines, match the strong cache-based baseline in mitigating forgetting, and significantly improving retrieval performance on new corpora.",

A DCGAN was used to create synthetic images which were mixed with real ones at various ratios to train a custom CNN. The CNN was then evaluated on a separate real-world test set. Our results indicate that the model maintains high sensitivity and precision in tumor classification, even when trained predominantly on synthetic data.

To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a Siamese-enabled rapid and continuous trust evaluation framework (SRCTE) to facilitate effective task collaboration. First, the communication and computing resource attributes of the collaborator in a trusted state, along with historical collaboration data, are collected and represented using an attributed control flow graph (ACFG) that captures trust-related semantic information and serves as a reference for comparison with data collected during task execution. At each time slot of task execution, the collaborator's communication and computing resource attributes, as well as task completion effectiveness, are collected in real time and represented with an ACFG to convey their trust-related semantic information. A Siamese model, consisting of two shared-parameter Structure2vec networks, is then employed to learn the deep semantics of each pair of ACFGs and generate their embeddings. Finally, the similarity between the embeddings of each pair of ACFGs is calculated to determine the collaborator's trust value at each time slot.

However, applying RL at scale remains intimidatingly resource-intensive, requiring multiple model copies and extensive GPU workloads. On the other hand, while being powerful, recent studies suggest that RL does not fundamentally endow models with new knowledge; rather, it primarily reshapes the model's output distribution to activate reasoning capabilities latent in the base model. Building on this insight, we hypothesize that the changes in output probabilities induced by RL are largely model-size invariant, opening the door to a more efficient paradigm: training a small model with RL and transferring its induced probability shifts to larger base models. To verify our hypothesis, we conduct a token-level analysis of decoding trajectories and find high alignment in RL-induced output distributions across model scales, validating our hypothesis. Motivated by this, we propose RAST, a simple yet effective method that transfers reasoning behaviors by injecting RL-induced probability adjustments from a small RL-trained model into larger models.

    "title": "ReasonGRM: Enhancing Generative Reward Models through Large Reasoning Models",
    "description": "arXiv:2506.16712v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Generative Reward Models (GRMs) provide greater flexibility than scalar reward models in capturing human preferences, but their effectiveness is limited by poor reasoning capabilities. This often results in incomplete or overly speculative reasoning paths, leading to hallucinations or missing key information in complex tasks. We address this challenge with ReasonGRM, a three-stage generative reward modeling framework. In the first stage, Zero-RL is used to generate concise, outcome-directed reasoning paths that reduce the likelihood of critical omissions. In the second stage, we introduce a novel evaluation metric, $R^star$, which scores reasoning paths based on their generation likelihood. This favors paths that reach correct answers with minimal exploration, helping to reduce hallucination-prone data during training. In the final stage, the model is further refined through reinforcement learning on challenging examples to enhance its preference discrimination capabilities. Experiments on three public benchmarks show that ReasonGRM achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous best GRMs by 1.8% on average and surpassing proprietary models such as GPT-4o by up to 5.6%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of reasoning-aware training and highlight the importance of high-quality rationale selection for reliable preference modeling.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.15756v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: This paper proposes RecBayes, a novel approach for ad hoc teamwork under partial observability, a setting where agents are deployed on-the-fly to environments where pre-existing teams operate, that never requires, at any stage, access to the states of the environment or the actions of its teammates. We show that by relying on a recurrent Bayesian classifier trained using past experiences, an ad hoc agent is effectively able to identify known teams and tasks being performed from observations alone. Unlike recent approaches such as PO-GPL (Gu et al., 2021) and FEAT (Rahman et al., 2023), that require at some stage fully observable states of the environment, actions of teammates, or both, or approaches such as ATPO (Ribeiro et al., 2023) that require the environments to be small enough to be tabularly modelled (Ribeiro et al., 2023), in their work up to 4.8K states and 1.7K observations, we show RecBayes is both able to handle arbitrarily large spaces while never relying on either states and teammates' actions. Our results in benchmark domains from the multi-agent systems literature, adapted for partial observability and scaled up to 1M states and 2^125 observations, show that RecBayes is effective at identifying known teams and tasks being performed from partial observations alone, and as a result, is able to assist the teams in solving the tasks effectively.",

While a related task, audio fingerprinting, has made significant progress in accurately retrieving musical content under 'real world' (noisy, reverberant) conditions, ASID systems struggle to identify samples that have undergone musical modifications. Thus, a system robust to common music production transformations such as time-stretching, pitch-shifting, effects processing, and underlying or overlaying music is an important open challenge. In this work, we propose a lightweight and scalable encoding architecture employing a Graph Neural Network within a contrastive learning framework. Our model uses only 9% of the trainable parameters compared to the current state-of-the-art system while achieving comparable performance, reaching a mean average precision (mAP) of 44.2%. To enhance retrieval quality, we introduce a two-stage approach consisting of an initial coarse similarity search for candidate selection, followed by a cross-attention classifier that rejects irrelevant matches and refines the ranking of retrieved candidates - an essential capability absent in prior models. In addition, because queries in real-world applications are often short in duration, we benchmark our system for short queries using new fine-grained annotations for the Sample100 dataset, which we publish as part of this work.",

    "title": "Reimagination with Test-time Observation Interventions: Distractor-Robust World Model Predictions for Visual Model Predictive Control",
    "description": "arXiv:2506.16565v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: World models enable robots to 'imagine' future observations given current observations and planned actions, and have been increasingly adopted as generalized dynamics models to facilitate robot learning. Despite their promise, these models remain brittle when encountering novel visual distractors such as objects and background elements rarely seen during training. Specifically, novel distractors can corrupt action outcome predictions, causing downstream failures when robots rely on the world model imaginations for planning or action verification. In this work, we propose Reimagination with Observation Intervention (ReOI), a simple yet effective test-time strategy that enables world models to predict more reliable action outcomes in open-world scenarios where novel and unanticipated visual distractors are inevitable. Given the current robot observation, ReOI first detects visual distractors by identifying which elements of the scene degrade in physically implausible ways during world model prediction. Then, it modifies the current observation to remove these distractors and bring the observation closer to the training distribution. Finally, ReOI 'reimagines' future outcomes with the modified observation and reintroduces the distractors post-hoc to preserve visual consistency for downstream planning and verification. We validate our approach on a suite of robotic manipulation tasks in the context of action verification, where the verifier needs to select desired action plans based on predictions from a world model. Our results show that ReOI is robust to both in-distribution and out-of-distribution visual distractors. Notably, it improves task success rates by up to 3x in the presence of novel distractors, significantly outperforming action verification that relies on world model predictions without imagination interventions.",

Mobile chargers have emerged as a flexible solution, capable of relocating to align with these demand fluctuations. This paper addresses the optimal planning and operation of hybrid charging infrastructures, integrating both fixed and mobile chargers within urban road networks. We introduce the Hybrid Charging Station Planning and Operation (HCSPO) problem, which simultaneously optimizes the location and configuration of fixed charging stations and schedules mobile chargers for dynamic operations. Our approach incorporates a charging demand prediction model grounded in Model Predictive Control (MPC) to enhance decision-making. To solve the HCSPO problem, we propose a deep reinforcement learning method, augmented with heuristic scheduling techniques, to effectively bridge the planning of fixed chargers with the real-time operation of mobile chargers. Extensive case studies using real-world urban scenarios demonstrate that our method significantly improves the availability of charging infrastructure and reduces user inconvenience compared to existing solutions and baselines.",

However, existing methods primarily approach multimodal reasoning in a straightforward, text-centric manner, where both reasoning and answer derivation are conducted purely through text, with the only difference being the presence of multimodal input. As a result, these methods often encounter fundamental limitations in spatial reasoning tasks that demand precise geometric understanding and continuous spatial tracking-capabilities that humans achieve through mental visualization and manipulation. To address the limitations, we propose drawing to reason in space, a novel paradigm that enables LVLMs to reason through elementary drawing operations in the visual space. By equipping models with basic drawing operations, including annotating bounding boxes and drawing auxiliary lines, we empower them to express and analyze spatial relationships through direct visual manipulation, meanwhile avoiding the performance ceiling imposed by specialized perception tools in previous tool-integrated reasoning approaches. To cultivate this capability, we develop a three-stage training framework: cold-start training with synthetic data to establish basic drawing abilities, reflective rejection sampling to enhance self-reflection behaviors, and reinforcement learning to directly optimize for target rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model, named VILASR, consistently outperforms existing methods across diverse spatial reasoning benchmarks, involving maze navigation, static spatial reasoning, video-based reasoning, and multi-view-based reasoning tasks, with an average improvement of 18.4%.",

This study proposed a novel framework, ReLPU, which enhances upsampling performance by explicitly learning from both global and local structural features of point clouds. Specifically, we extracted global features from uniformly segmented inputs (Average Segments) and local features from patch-based inputs of the same point cloud. These two types of features were processed through parallel autoencoders, fused, and then fed into a shared decoder for upsampling. This dual-input design improved feature completeness and cross-scale consistency, especially in sparse and noisy regions. Our framework was applied to several state-of-the-art autoencoder-based networks and validated on standard datasets. Experimental results demonstrated consistent improvements in geometric fidelity and robustness.

This study proposed a novel framework, ReLPU, which enhances upsampling performance by explicitly learning from both global and local structural features of point clouds. Specifically, we extracted global features from uniformly segmented inputs (Average Segments) and local features from patch-based inputs of the same point cloud. These two types of features were processed through parallel autoencoders, fused, and then fed into a shared decoder for upsampling. This dual-input design improved feature completeness and cross-scale consistency, especially in sparse and noisy regions. Our framework was applied to several state-of-the-art autoencoder-based networks and validated on standard datasets. Experimental results demonstrated consistent improvements in geometric fidelity and robustness. In addition, saliency maps confirmed that parallel global-local learning significantly enhanced the interpretability and performance of point cloud upsampling.",

    "description": "arXiv:2505.07895v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Nowadays, numerous online platforms can be described as multi-modal heterogeneous networks (MMHNs), such as Douban's movie networks and Amazon's product review networks. Accurately categorizing nodes within these networks is crucial for analyzing the corresponding entities, which requires effective representation learning on nodes. However, existing multi-modal fusion methods often adopt either early fusion strategies which may lose the unique characteristics of individual modalities, or late fusion approaches overlooking the cross-modal guidance in GNN-based information propagation. In this paper, we propose a novel model for node classification in MMHNs, named Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network with Inter-Modal Attention (HGNN-IMA). It learns node representations by capturing the mutual influence of multiple modalities during the information propagation process, within the framework of heterogeneous graph transformer. Specifically, a nested inter-modal attention mechanism is integrated into the inter-node attention to achieve adaptive multi-modal fusion, and modality alignment is also taken into account to encourage the propagation among nodes with consistent similarities across all modalities. Moreover, an attention loss is augmented to mitigate the impact of missing modalities. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of the model in the node classification task, providing an innovative view to handle multi-modal data, especially when accompanied with network structures.",

This raises a critical question: how should model training be modified to optimize performance under a subsequent test-time compute strategy and budget? To explore this, we focus on pass@N, a simple test-time strategy that searches for a correct answer in $N$ independent samples. We show, surprisingly, that training with cross-entropy (CE) loss can be ${it misaligned}$ with pass@N in that pass@N accuracy ${it decreases}$ with longer training. We explain the origins of this misalignment in terms of model overconfidence induced by CE, and experimentally verify our prediction of overconfidence as an impediment to scaling test-time compute via pass@N. Furthermore we suggest a principled, modified training loss that is better aligned to pass@N by limiting model confidence and rescuing pass@N test performance. Our algorithm demonstrates improved mathematical reasoning on MATH and MiniF2F benchmarks under several scenarios: (1) providing answers to math questions; and (2) proving theorems by searching over proof trees of varying shapes.

Our method covers six gradient-based layout attack scenarios, incorporating manipulations of OCR bounding boxes, pixels, and texts across both word and line granularities, with constraints on layout perturbation budget (e.g., IoU >= 0.6) to preserve plausibility. Experimental results across four datasets (FUNSD, CORD, SROIE, DocVQA) and six model families demonstrate that line-level attacks and compound perturbations (BBox + Pixel + Text) yield the most severe performance degradation. Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)-based BBox perturbations outperform random-shift baselines in all investigated models. Ablation studies further validate the impact of layout budget, text modification, and adversarial transferability.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.15847v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: For robots to become efficient helpers in the home, they must learn to perform new mobile manipulation tasks simply by watching humans perform them. Learning from a single video demonstration from a human is challenging as the robot needs to first extract from the demo what needs to be done and how, translate the strategy from a third to a first-person perspective, and then adapt it to be successful with its own morphology. Furthermore, to mitigate the dependency on costly human monitoring, this learning process should be performed in a safe and autonomous manner. We present SafeMimic, a framework to learn new mobile manipulation skills safely and autonomously from a single third-person human video. Given an initial human video demonstration of a multi-step mobile manipulation task, SafeMimic first parses the video into segments, inferring both the semantic changes caused and the motions the human executed to achieve them and translating them to an egocentric reference. Then, it adapts the behavior to the robot's own morphology by sampling candidate actions around the human ones, and verifying them for safety before execution in a receding horizon fashion using an ensemble of safety Q-functions trained in simulation. When safe forward progression is not possible, SafeMimic backtracks to previous states and attempts a different sequence of actions, adapting both the trajectory and the grasping modes when required for its morphology. As a result, SafeMimic yields a strategy that succeeds in the demonstrated behavior and learns task-specific actions that reduce exploration in future attempts. Our experiments show that our method allows robots to safely and efficiently learn multi-step mobile manipulation behaviors from a single human demonstration, from different users, and in different environments, with improvements over state-of-the-art baselines across seven tasks",

These agents are often fine-tuned on limited user-generated datasets, leaving them vulnerable to covert threats during the training process. In this work we present GHOST, the first clean-label backdoor attack specifically designed for mobile agents built upon VLMs. Our method manipulates only the visual inputs of a portion of the training samples - without altering their corresponding labels or instructions - thereby injecting malicious behaviors into the model. Once fine-tuned with this tampered data, the agent will exhibit attacker-controlled responses when a specific visual trigger is introduced at inference time. The core of our approach lies in aligning the gradients of poisoned samples with those of a chosen target instance, embedding backdoor-relevant features into the poisoned training data. To maintain stealth and enhance robustness, we develop three realistic visual triggers: static visual patches, dynamic motion cues, and subtle low-opacity overlays. We evaluate our method across six real-world Android apps and three VLM architectures adapted for mobile use. Results show that our attack achieves high attack success rates (up to 94.67 percent) while maintaining high clean-task performance (FSR up to 95.85 percent). Additionally, ablation studies shed light on how various design choices affect the efficacy and concealment of the attack.

However, prior approaches typically rely on static, pre-processed database information provided at inference time, which limits the model's ability to fully understand the database contents. Without dynamic interaction, LLMs are constrained to fixed, human-provided context and cannot autonomously explore the underlying data. To address this limitation, we propose SDE-SQL, a framework that enables large language models to perform self-driven exploration of databases during inference. This is accomplished by generating and executing SQL probes, which allow the model to actively retrieve information from the database and iteratively update its understanding of the data. Unlike prior methods, SDE-SQL operates in a zero-shot setting, without relying on any question-SQL pairs as in-context demonstrations. When evaluated on the BIRD benchmark with Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, SDE-SQL achieves an 8.02% relative improvement in execution accuracy over the vanilla Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct baseline, establishing a new state-of-the-art among methods based on open-source models without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or model ensembling.

Although there has been significant progress on this topic, we notice that in the process of solving such issues, existing agentic systems tend to hyper-localize on immediately suspicious lines of code and fix them in isolation, without a deeper understanding of the issue semantics, code semantics, or execution semantics. Consequently, many existing systems generate patches that overfit to the user issue, even when a more general fix is preferable. To address this limitation, we introduce SemAgent, a novel workflow-based procedure that leverages issue, code, and execution semantics to generate patches that are complete - identifying and fixing all lines relevant to the issue. We achieve this through a novel pipeline that (a) leverages execution semantics to retrieve relevant context, (b) comprehends issue-semantics via generalized abstraction, (c) isolates code-semantics within the context of this abstraction, and (d) leverages this understanding in a two-stage architecture: a repair stage that proposes fine-grained fixes, followed by a reviewer stage that filters relevant fixes based on the inferred issue-semantics. Our evaluations show that our methodology achieves a solve rate of 44.66% on the SWEBench-Lite benchmark beating all other workflow-based approaches, and an absolute improvement of 7.66% compared to our baseline, which lacks such deep semantic understanding.

    "description": "arXiv:2506.15740v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents in complex and long horizon settings, it is critical to evaluate their ability to sabotage users by pursuing hidden objectives. We study the ability of frontier LLMs to evade monitoring and achieve harmful hidden goals while completing a wide array of realistic tasks. We evaluate a broad range of frontier LLMs using SHADE (Subtle Harmful Agent Detection & Evaluation)-Arena, the first highly diverse agent evaluation dataset for sabotage and monitoring capabilities of LLM agents. SHADE-Arena consists of complex pairs of benign main tasks and harmful side objectives in complicated environments. Agents are evaluated on their ability to complete the side task without appearing suspicious to an LLM monitor. When measuring agent ability to (a) complete the main task, (b) complete the side task, and (c) avoid detection, we find that the best performing frontier models score 27% (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) and 15% (Gemini 2.5 Pro) as sabotage agents when overseen by Claude 3.6 Sonnet.

    "summary": "arXiv:2506.15740v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents in complex and long horizon settings, it is critical to evaluate their ability to sabotage users by pursuing hidden objectives. We study the ability of frontier LLMs to evade monitoring and achieve harmful hidden goals while completing a wide array of realistic tasks. We evaluate a broad range of frontier LLMs using SHADE (Subtle Harmful Agent Detection & Evaluation)-Arena, the first highly diverse agent evaluation dataset for sabotage and monitoring capabilities of LLM agents. SHADE-Arena consists of complex pairs of benign main tasks and harmful side objectives in complicated environments. Agents are evaluated on their ability to complete the side task without appearing suspicious to an LLM monitor. When measuring agent ability to (a) complete the main task, (b) complete the side task, and (c) avoid detection, we find that the best performing frontier models score 27% (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) and 15% (Gemini 2.5 Pro) as sabotage agents when overseen by Claude 3.6 Sonnet. For current frontier models, success on the side task relies heavily on having access to a hidden scratchpad that is not visible to the monitor. We also use SHADE-Arena to measure models' monitoring abilities, with the top monitor (Gemini 2.5 Pro) achieving an AUC of 0.87 at distinguishing benign and malign transcripts.

    "title": "Shadow defense against gradient inversion attack in federated learning",
    "description": "arXiv:2506.15711v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative framework for privacy-preserving distributed training, allowing clients to collaboratively train a global model without sharing their local data. This is especially crucial in sensitive fields like healthcare, where protecting patient data is paramount. However, privacy leakage remains a critical challenge, as the communication of model updates can be exploited by potential adversaries. Gradient inversion attacks (GIAs), for instance, allow adversaries to approximate the gradients used for training and reconstruct training images, thus stealing patient privacy. Existing defense mechanisms obscure gradients, yet lack a nuanced understanding of which gradients or types of image information are most vulnerable to such attacks. These indiscriminate calibrated perturbations result in either excessive privacy protection degrading model accuracy, or insufficient one failing to safeguard sensitive information. Therefore, we introduce a framework that addresses these challenges by leveraging a shadow model with interpretability for identifying sensitive areas. This enables a more targeted and sample-specific noise injection. Specially, our defensive strategy achieves discrepancies of 3.73 in PSNR and 0.2 in SSIM compared to the circumstance without defense on the ChestXRay dataset, and 2.78 in PSNR and 0.166 in the EyePACS dataset. Moreover, it minimizes adverse effects on model performance, with less than 1% F1 reduction compared to SOTA methods. Our extensive experiments, conducted across diverse types of medical images, validate the generalization of the proposed framework. The stable defense improvements for FedAvg are consistently over 1.5% times in LPIPS and SSIM. It also offers a universal defense against various GIA types, especially for these sensitive areas in images.",

We demonstrate an artificial intelligence approach for rapid, non-destructive estimation of the chemical potential and temperature from single-shot, in situ imaged density profiles of finite-temperature Bose gases. Our convolutional neural network is trained exclusively on quasi-2D `pancake' condensates in harmonic trap configurations. It achieves parameter extraction within fractions of a second. The model also demonstrates zero-shot generalisation across both trap geometry and thermalisation dynamics, successfully estimating thermodynamic parameters for toroidally trapped condensates with errors of only a few nanokelvin despite no prior exposure to such geometries during training, and maintaining predictive accuracy during dynamic thermalisation processes after a relatively brief evolution without explicit training on non-equilibrium states. These results suggest that supervised learning can overcome traditional limitations in ultracold atom thermometry, with extension to broader geometric configurations, temperature ranges, and additional parameters potentially enabling comprehensive real-time analysis of quantum gas experiments.

However, their high computational cost and low execution frequency hinder their suitability for real-time tasks such as robotic manipulation and autonomous navigation. Existing VLA acceleration methods primarily focus on structural optimization, overlooking the fact that these models operate in sequential decision-making environments. As a result, temporal redundancy in sequential action generation and spatial redundancy in visual input remain unaddressed. To this end, we propose SP-VLA, a unified framework that accelerates VLA models by jointly scheduling models and pruning tokens. Specifically, we design an action-aware model scheduling mechanism that reduces temporal redundancy by dynamically switching between VLA model and a lightweight generator. Inspired by the human motion pattern of focusing on key decision points while relying on intuition for other actions, we categorize VLA actions into deliberative and intuitive, assigning the former to the VLA model and the latter to the lightweight generator, enabling frequency-adaptive execution through collaborative model scheduling. To address spatial redundancy, we further develop a spatio-semantic dual-aware token pruning method. Tokens are classified into spatial and semantic types and pruned based on their dual-aware importance to accelerate VLA inference. These two mechanisms work jointly to guide the VLA in focusing on critical actions and salient visual information, achieving effective acceleration while maintaining high accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves up to 1.5$times$ acceleration with less than 3% drop in accuracy, outperforming existing approaches in multiple tasks.",

(2) planning agent, which further details events and plans which events should be written in each chapter to maintain an interwoven and engaging story. (3) writing agent, which dynamically compresses the story history based on the current event to generate and reflect new plots, ensuring the coherence of the generated story. We conduct both human and automated evaluation, and StoryWriter significantly outperforms existing story generation baselines in both story quality and length. Furthermore, we use StoryWriter to generate a dataset, which contains about $6,000$ high-quality long stories, with an average length of $8,000$ words. We train the model Llama3.1-8B and GLM4-9B using supervised fine-tuning on LongStory and develop StoryWriter_GLM and StoryWriter_GLM, which demonstrates advanced performance in long story generation.",

We propose to address this problem, framing SP estimation as a task independent of subgraph frequency estimation. Our approach shifts from frequency counting to direct SP estimation and modulates the problem as multitarget regression. The reformulation is optimised for interpretability, stability and scalability on large graphs. We validate our method using a large synthetic dataset and further test it on real-world graphs. Our experiments reveal that 1-WL limited models struggle to make precise estimations of SPs. However, they can generalise to approximate the graph generation processes of networks by comparing their predicted SP with the ones originating from synthetic generators.

Despite decades of progress, this trifecta remains elusive. Classical methods like Kinetic Monte Carlo ensure thermodynamic accuracy but scale poorly; learning-based methods offer efficiency but often sacrifice physical consistency and interpretability. We present SwarmThinkers, a reinforcement learning framework that recasts atomic-scale simulation as a physically grounded swarm intelligence system. Each diffusing particle is modeled as a local decision-making agent that selects transitions via a shared policy network trained under thermodynamic constraints. A reweighting mechanism fuses learned preferences with transition rates, preserving statistical fidelity while enabling interpretable, step-wise decision making. Training follows a centralized-training, decentralized-execution paradigm, allowing the policy to generalize across system sizes, concentrations, and temperatures without retraining. On a benchmark simulating radiation-induced Fe-Cu alloy precipitation, SwarmThinkers is the first system to achieve full-scale, physically consistent simulation on a single A100 GPU, previously attainable only via OpenKMC on a supercomputer. It delivers up to 4963x (3185x on average) faster computation with 485x lower memory usage.

In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated pipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our pipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce SWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment construction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a collaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to enhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based grading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers. Finally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit code signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show that our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example, with GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per instance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at the lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our exit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection, and our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall of 1.00.

SyncMapV2 exhibits a minimal drop in mIoU, only 0.01%, under digital corruption, compared to a 23.8% drop observed in SOTA methods.This superior performance extends across various types of corruption: noise (7.3% vs. 37.7%), weather (7.5% vs. 33.8%), and blur (7.0% vs. 29.5%). Notably, SyncMapV2 accomplishes this without any robust training, supervision, or loss functions. It is based on a learning paradigm that uses self-organizing dynamical equations combined with concepts from random networks. Moreover,unlike conventional methods that require re-initialization for each new input, SyncMapV2 adapts online, mimicking the continuous adaptability of human vision. Thus, we go beyond the accurate and robust results, and present the first algorithm that can do all the above online, adapting to input rather than re-initializing.

Prior research has revealed that LLMs often fail to grasp the notion of safe behaviors, resulting in either unjustified refusals to harmless prompts or the generation of harmful content. While substantial efforts have been made to improve their robustness, existing defenses often rely on costly fine-tuning of model parameters or employ suboptimal heuristic techniques. In this work, we take a novel approach to safeguard LLMs by learning to adapt the system prompts in instruction-tuned LLMs. While LLMs are typically pre-trained to follow a fixed system prompt, we investigate the impact of tailoring the system prompt to each specific user input on the safety of the responses. To this end, we propose $textbf{Sysformer}$, a trans$textbf{former}$ model that updates an initial $textbf{sys}$tem prompt to a more robust system prompt in the LLM input embedding space while attending to the user prompt. While keeping the LLM parameters frozen, the Sysformer is trained to refuse to respond to a set of harmful prompts while responding ideally to a set of safe ones. Through extensive experiments on $5$ LLMs from different families and $2$ recent benchmarks, we demonstrate that Sysformer can significantly enhance the robustness of LLMs, leading to upto $80%$ gain in the refusal rate on harmful prompts while enhancing the compliance with the safe prompts by upto $90%$. Results also generalize well to sophisticated jailbreaking attacks, making LLMs upto $100%$ more robust against different attack strategies. We hope our findings lead to cheaper safeguarding of LLMs and motivate future investigations into designing variable system prompts.",

However, modeling real-world environments presents unique challenges as they dynamically change across both space and, crucially, time. To capture these composed dynamics, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal Road Image Dataset for Exploration (STRIDE) permuting 360-degree panoramic imagery into rich interconnected observation, state and action nodes. Leveraging this structure, we can simultaneously model the relationship between egocentric views, positional coordinates, and movement commands across both space and time. We benchmark this dataset via TARDIS, a transformer-based generative world model that integrates spatial and temporal dynamics through a unified autoregressive framework trained on STRIDE. We demonstrate robust performance across a range of agentic tasks such as controllable photorealistic image synthesis, instruction following, autonomous self-control, and state-of-the-art georeferencing. These results suggest a promising direction towards sophisticated generalist agents--capable of understanding and manipulating the spatial and temporal aspects of their material environments--with enhanced embodied reasoning capabilities.

Current test-time scaling methods primarily optimize for accuracy based on total compute resources (FLOPS), often overlooking latency constraints. To address this gap, we propose $texttt{SPECS}$, a latency-aware test-time scaling method inspired by speculative decoding. $texttt{SPECS}$~uses a smaller, faster model to generate candidate sequences efficiently, and evaluates these candidates using signals from both a larger target model and a dedicated reward model. We introduce new integration strategies, including reward-guided soft verification and a reward-based deferral mechanism.

In this work, we perform a systematic study on the impact of model scale and the degree of feature learning in continual learning. We reconcile existing contradictory observations on scale in the literature, by differentiating between lazy and rich training regimes through a variable parameterization of the architecture. We show that increasing model width is only beneficial when it reduces the amount of feature learning, yielding more laziness. Using the framework of dynamical mean field theory, we then study the infinite width dynamics of the model in the feature learning regime and characterize CF, extending prior theoretical results limited to the lazy regime. We study the intricate relationship between feature learning, task non-stationarity, and forgetting, finding that high feature learning is only beneficial with highly similar tasks. We identify a transition modulated by task similarity where the model exits an effectively lazy regime with low forgetting to enter a rich regime with significant forgetting. Finally, our findings reveal that neural networks achieve optimal performance at a critical level of feature learning, which depends on task non-stationarity and transfers across model scales.

To address this, we introduce MedPerturb, a dataset designed to systematically evaluate medical LLMs under controlled perturbations of clinical input. MedPerturb consists of clinical vignettes spanning a range of pathologies, each transformed along three axes: (1) gender modifications (e.g., gender-swapping or gender-removal); (2) style variation (e.g., uncertain phrasing or colloquial tone); and (3) format changes (e.g., LLM-generated multi-turn conversations or summaries). With MedPerturb, we release a dataset of 800 clinical contexts grounded in realistic input variability, outputs from four LLMs, and three human expert reads per clinical context. We use MedPerturb in two case studies to reveal how shifts in gender identity cues, language style, or format reflect diverging treatment selections between humans and LLMs. We find that LLMs are more sensitive to gender and style perturbations while human annotators are more sensitive to LLM-generated format perturbations such as clinical summaries.

However, quantifying epistemic uncertainty in such tasks is challenging due to the presence of aleatoric uncertainty, which arises from multiple valid answers. While bias can introduce noise into epistemic uncertainty estimation, it may also reduce noise from aleatoric uncertainty. To investigate this trade-off, we conduct experiments on Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks and find that mitigating prompt-introduced bias improves uncertainty quantification in GPT-4o. Building on prior work showing that LLMs tend to copy input information when model confidence is low, we further analyze how these prompt biases affect measured epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty across varying bias-free confidence levels with GPT-4o and Qwen2-VL. We find that all considered biases induce greater changes in both uncertainties when bias-free model confidence is lower. Moreover, lower bias-free model confidence leads to greater underestimation of epistemic uncertainty (i.e. overconfidence) due to bias, whereas it has no significant effect on the direction of changes in aleatoric uncertainty estimation.

Unlike traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), VLMs face unique vulnerabilities due to their multimodal nature, allowing adversaries to modify visual or textual inputs to bypass safety guardrails and trigger the generation of harmful content. Through systematic analysis of VLM behavior under attack, we identify a novel phenomenon termed ``delayed safety awareness''. Specifically, we observe that safety-aligned VLMs may initially be compromised to produce harmful content, but eventually recognize the associated risks and attempt to self-correct. This pattern suggests that VLMs retain their underlying safety awareness but experience a temporal delay in their activation. Building on this insight, we hypothesize that VLMs' safety awareness can be proactively reactivated through carefully designed prompts. To this end, we introduce ``The Safety Reminder'', a soft prompt tuning approach that optimizes learnable prompt tokens, which are periodically injected during the text generation process to enhance safety awareness, effectively preventing harmful content generation. Additionally, our safety reminder only activates when harmful content is detected, leaving normal conversations unaffected and preserving the model's performance on benign tasks. Through comprehensive evaluation across three established safety benchmarks and one adversarial attacks, we demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces attack success rates while maintaining model utility, offering a practical solution for deploying safer VLMs in real-world applications.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2504.20007v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: This paper proposes a novel interdisciplinary framework for analyzing police body-worn camera (BWC) footage from the Rochester Police Department (RPD) using advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and statistical machine learning (ML) techniques. Our goal is to detect, classify, and analyze patterns of interaction between police officers and civilians to identify key behavioral dynamics, such as respect, disrespect, escalation, and de-escalation. We apply multimodal data analysis by integrating image, audio, and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract meaningful insights from BWC footage. The framework incorporates speaker separation, transcription, and large language models (LLMs) to produce structured, interpretable summaries of police-civilian encounters. We also employ a custom evaluation pipeline to assess transcription quality and behavior detection accuracy in high-stakes, real-world policing scenarios.

The paradigm employs a modular architecture of four LLM-powered agents (Master, Planner, Executor and Writer) that dynamically adapt to the full spectrum of information needs, from simple factual queries to complex multi-stage reasoning tasks. These agents collaborate dynamically through coordinated workflows to evaluate query complexity, decompose problems into executable plans, and orchestrate tool usage, task execution, and content synthesis. We systematically present key methodologies for realizing this paradigm, including task planning and tool integration, execution strategies, aligned and robust retrieval-augmented generation, and efficient LLM inference, spanning both algorithmic techniques and infrastructure-level optimizations.

Numerous false positives (FPs) in these reports reduce the effectiveness of security analysis. We propose using Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve the assessment of SAST findings. We investigate the ability of LLMs to reduce FPs while trying to maintain a perfect true positive rate, using datasets extracted from the OWASP Benchmark (v1.2) and a real-world software project. Our results indicate that advanced prompting techniques, such as Chain-of-Thought and Self-Consistency, substantially improve FP detection. Notably, some LLMs identified approximately 62.5% of FPs in the OWASP Benchmark dataset without missing genuine weaknesses. Combining detections from different LLMs would increase this FP detection to approximately 78.9%. Additionally, we demonstrate our approach's generalizability using a real-world dataset covering five SAST tools, three programming languages, and infrastructure files. The best LLM detected 33.85% of all FPs without missing genuine weaknesses, while combining detections from different LLMs would increase this detection to 38.46%.

However, these methods often suffer from computational inefficiency and tend to provide suboptimal partitioning schemes. To address this problem more effectively, we analyze the weight coupling problem from a novel perspective, which primarily stems from distinct modules in succeeding layers imposing conflicting gradient directions on the preceding layer modules. Based on this perspective, we propose the Gradient Contribution (GC) method that efficiently computes the cosine similarity of gradient directions among modules by decomposing the Vector-Jacobian Product during supernet backpropagation. Subsequently, the modules with conflicting gradient directions are allocated to distinct sub-supernets while similar ones are grouped together. To assess the advantages of GC and address the limitations of existing Graph Neural Architecture Search methods, which are limited to searching a single type of Graph Neural Networks (Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) or Graph Transformers (GTs)), we propose the Unified Graph Neural Architecture Search (UGAS) framework, which explores optimal combinations of MPNNs and GTs. The experimental results demonstrate that GC achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in supernet partitioning quality and time efficiency. In addition, the architectures searched by UGAS+GC outperform both the manually designed GNNs and those obtained by existing NAS methods.

While much of the research has traditionally focused on harmful speech in general, the need for generalizable techniques to detect veiled and subtle forms of hate has become increasingly pressing. Based on lexicon analysis, we hypothesize that implicit hate speech is already present in publicly available harmful speech datasets but may not have been explicitly recognized or labeled by annotators. Additionally, crowdsourced datasets are prone to mislabeling due to the complexity of the task and often influenced by annotators' subjective interpretations. In this paper, we propose an approach to address the detection of implicit hate speech and enhance generalizability across diverse datasets by leveraging existing harmful speech datasets. Our method comprises three key components: influential sample identification, reannotation, and augmentation using Llama-3 70B and GPT-4o.

In this paper, we introduce Tower+, a suite of models designed to deliver strong performance across both translation and multilingual general-purpose text capabilities.

At each stage of training, we carefully generate and curate data to strengthen performance on translation as well as general-purpose tasks involving code generation, mathematics problem solving, and general instruction-following.

To examine this hypothesis, we introduce BICAUSE, a structured bilingual dataset for causal reasoning, which includes semantically aligned Chinese and English samples in both forward and reversed causal forms. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) LLMs exhibit typologically aligned attention patterns, focusing more on causes and sentence-initial connectives in Chinese, while showing a more balanced distribution in English. (2) Models internalize language-specific preferences for causal word order and often rigidly apply them to atypical inputs, leading to degraded performance, especially in Chinese. (3) When causal reasoning succeeds, model representations converge toward semantically aligned abstractions across languages, indicating a shared understanding beyond surface form. Overall, these results suggest that LLMs not only mimic surface linguistic forms but also internalize the reasoning biases shaped by language.

(3) When causal reasoning succeeds, model representations converge toward semantically aligned abstractions across languages, indicating a shared understanding beyond surface form. Overall, these results suggest that LLMs not only mimic surface linguistic forms but also internalize the reasoning biases shaped by language. Rooted in cognitive linguistic theory, this phenomenon is for the first time empirically verified through structural analysis of model internals.",

    "title": "Understanding and Reducing the Class-Dependent Effects of Data Augmentation with A Two-Player Game Approach",
    "description": "arXiv:2407.03146v4 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Data augmentation is widely applied and has shown its benefits in different machine learning tasks. However, as recently observed, it may have an unfair effect in multi-class classification. While data augmentation generally improves the overall performance (and therefore is beneficial for many classes), it can actually be detrimental for other classes, which can be problematic in some application domains. In this paper, to counteract this phenomenon, we propose CLAM, a CLAss-dependent Multiplicative-weights method. To derive it, we first formulate the training of a classifier as a non-linear optimization problem that aims at simultaneously maximizing the individual class performances and balancing them. By rewriting this optimization problem as an adversarial two-player game, we propose a novel multiplicative weight algorithm, for which we prove the convergence. Interestingly, our formulation also reveals that the class-dependent effects of data augmentation is not due to data augmentation only, but is in fact a general phenomenon. Our empirical results over six datasets demonstrate that the performance of learned classifiers is indeed more fairly distributed over classes, with only limited impact on the average accuracy.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.15722v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Metamaterials are artificial materials that are designed to meet unseen properties in nature, such as ultra-stiffness and negative materials indices. In mechanical metamaterial design, three key modalities are typically involved, i.e., 3D topology, density condition, and mechanical property. Real-world complex application scenarios place the demanding requirements on machine learning models to consider all three modalities together. However, a comprehensive literature review indicates that most existing works only consider two modalities, e.g., predicting mechanical properties given the 3D topology or generating 3D topology given the required properties. Therefore, there is still a significant gap for the state-of-the-art machine learning models capturing the whole. Hence, we propose a unified model named UNIMATE, which consists of a modality alignment module and a synergetic diffusion generation module. Experiments indicate that UNIMATE outperforms the other baseline models in topology generation task, property prediction task, and condition confirmation task by up to 80.2%, 5.1%, and 50.2%, respectively.

    "description": "arXiv:2506.15803v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Objective. Proton arc therapy (PAT) is an emerging and promising modality in radiotherapy, offering several advantages over conventional intensitymodulated proton therapy (IMPT). However, identifying the optimal energy layer (EL) sequence remains computationally intensive due to the large number of possible energy layer transitions. This study proposes an unsupervised deep learning framework for fast and effective EL pre-selection, aiming to minimize energy layer switch time while preserving high plan quality. Approach. We introduce a novel data representation method, spot-count representation, which encodes the number of proton spots intersecting the target and organs at risk (OARs) in a matrix structured by sorted gantry angles and energy layers. This representation is the input of a UNet-based architecture, SPArcdl, which is trained to optimize a tri-objective function: maximizing target coverage, minimizing OAR exposure, and reducing energy switching time. The model is evaluated on 54 nasopharyngeal cancer cases, and its performance is benchmarked against plans generated by SPArcparticle swarm. Main results. SPArcdl produces EL pre-selection that significantly improves both plan quality and delivery efficiency. Compared to SPArc particle swarm, it enhances the conformity index by 0.16 (p < 0.01), reduces the homogeneity index by 0.71 (p < 0.01), shortens the energy switching time by 38.4% (p < 0.01), and lowers the mean dose to brainstem by 0.21 (p < 0.01). The results unintentionally reveal employing unchanged ELS is more time-wise efficient than descended ELS. SPArcdl's inference time is within 1 second. Significance. SPArcdl is a fast and effective tool for generating high-quality PAT plans by strategically pre-selecting energy layers to reduce delivery time while maintaining excellent dosimetric performance.",

    "description": "arXiv:2411.05409v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Current metadata creation for web archives is time consuming and costly due to reliance on human effort. This paper explores the use of gpt-4o for metadata generation within the Web Archive Singapore, focusing on scalability, efficiency, and cost effectiveness. We processed 112 Web ARChive (WARC) files using data reduction techniques, achieving a notable 99.9% reduction in metadata generation costs. By prompt engineering, we generated titles and abstracts, which were evaluated both intrinsically using Levenshtein Distance and BERTScore, and extrinsically with human cataloguers using McNemar's test. Results indicate that while our method offers significant cost savings and efficiency gains, human curated metadata maintains an edge in quality. The study identifies key challenges including content inaccuracies, hallucinations, and translation issues, suggesting that Large Language Models (LLMs) should serve as complements rather than replacements for human cataloguers. Future work will focus on refining prompts, improving content filtering, and addressing privacy concerns through experimentation with smaller models. This research advances the integration of LLMs in web archiving, offering valuable insights into their current capabilities and outlining directions for future enhancements. The code is available at https://github.com/masamune-prog/warc2summary for further development and use by institutions facing similar challenges.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.14777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: This article introduces WebXAII, an open-source web framework designed to facilitate research on human interaction with eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) systems. The field of XAI is rapidly expanding, driven by the growing societal implications of the widespread adoption of AI (and in particular machine learning) across diverse applications. Researchers who study the interaction between humans and XAI techniques typically develop ad hoc interfaces in order to conduct their studies. These interfaces are usually not shared alongside the results of the studies, which limits their reusability and the reproducibility of experiments. In response, we design and implement WebXAII, a web-based platform that can embody full experimental protocols, meaning that it can present all aspects of the experiment to human participants and record their responses. The experimental protocols are translated into a composite architecture of generic views and modules, which offers a lot of flexibility. The architecture is defined in a structured configuration file, so that protocols can be implemented with minimal programming skills. We demonstrate that WebXAII can effectively embody relevant protocols, by reproducing the protocol of a state-of-the-art study of the literature.",

This paper studies this issue analytically, presenting a linear model that encapsulates the essence of LAM learning, while being tractable.This provides several insights, including connections between LAM and principal component analysis (PCA), desiderata of the data-generating policy, and justification of strategies to encourage learning controllable changes using data augmentation, data cleaning, and auxiliary action-prediction.

    "title": "What Is the Point of Equality in Machine Learning Fairness? Beyond Equality of Opportunity",
    "description": "arXiv:2506.16782v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Fairness in machine learning (ML) has become a rapidly growing area of research. But why, in the first place, is unfairness in ML morally wrong? And why should we care about improving fairness? Most fair-ML research implicitly appeals to distributive equality: the idea that desirable goods and benefits, such as opportunities (e.g., Barocas et al., 2023), should be equally distributed across society. Unfair ML models, then, are seen as wrong because they unequally distribute such benefits. This paper argues that this exclusive focus on distributive equality offers an incomplete and potentially misleading ethical foundation. Grounding ML fairness in egalitarianism -- the view that equality is a fundamental moral and social ideal -- requires challenging structural inequality: systematic, institutional, and durable arrangements that privilege some groups while disadvantaging others. Structural inequality manifests through ML systems in two primary forms: allocative harms (e.g., economic loss) and representational harms (e.g., stereotypes, erasure). While distributive equality helps address allocative harms, it fails to explain why representational harms are wrong -- why it is wrong for ML systems to reinforce social hierarchies that stratify people into superior and inferior groups -- and why ML systems should aim to foster a society where people relate as equals (i.e., relational equality). To address these limitations, the paper proposes a multifaceted egalitarian framework for ML fairness that integrates both distributive and relational equality. Drawing on critical social and political philosophy, this framework offers a more comprehensive ethical foundation for tackling the full spectrum of harms perpetuated by ML systems. The paper also outlines practical pathways for implementing the framework across the ML pipeline.",

    "title": "When Can Model-Free Reinforcement Learning be Enough for Thinking?",
    "description": "arXiv:2506.17124v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Recent work on large language models has demonstrated the use of model-free reinforcement learning (RL) to train reasoning-like capabilities. The emergence of 'thinking' through model-free RL is interesting as thinking actions neither produce reward nor change the external world state to one where the agent is more likely to get reward. This paper seeks to build a domain-independent understanding of when model-free RL will lead to 'thinking' as a strategy for reward maximization. To build this understanding, we first introduce a theoretical model which we call a textit{thought Markov decision process} (MDP). Thought MDPs minimally extend the classical MDP model to include an abstract notion of thought state and thought action. Using the thought MDP model, we prove the importance of policy initialization in determining whether or not thinking emerges and show formally that thought actions are equivalent to the agent choosing to perform a step of policy improvement before continuing to act. We then show that open-source LLMs satisfy the conditions that our theory predicts are necessary for model-free RL to produce thinking-like behavior. Finally, we hypothesize sufficient conditions that would enable thinking to be learned outside of language generation and introduce a toy domain where a combination of multi-task pre-training and designated thought actions enable more data-efficient RL compared to non-thinking agents.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.16895v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Multimodal models have demonstrated powerful capabilities in complex tasks requiring multimodal alignment including zero-shot classification and cross-modal retrieval. However, existing models typically rely on millions of paired multimodal samples, which are prohibitively expensive or infeasible to obtain in many domains. In this work, we explore the feasibility of building multimodal models with limited amount of paired data by aligning pretrained unimodal foundation models. We show that high-quality alignment is possible with as few as tens of thousands of paired samples$unicode{x2013}$less than $1%$ of the data typically used in the field. To achieve this, we introduce STRUCTURE, an effective regularization technique that preserves the neighborhood geometry of the latent space of unimodal encoders. Additionally, we show that aligning last layers is often suboptimal and demonstrate the benefits of aligning the layers with the highest representational similarity across modalities. These two components can be readily incorporated into existing alignment methods, yielding substantial gains across 24 zero-shot image classification and retrieval benchmarks, with average relative improvement of $51.6%$ in classification and $91.8%$ in retrieval tasks. Our results highlight the effectiveness and broad applicability of our framework for limited-sample multimodal learning and offer a promising path forward for resource-constrained domains.",

However, DNN verifiers are themselves complex programs that have been shown to be susceptible to errors and numerical imprecision; this, in turn, has raised the question of trust in DNN verifiers. One prominent attempt to address this issue is enhancing DNN verifiers with the capability of producing certificates of their results that are subject to independent algorithmic checking. While formulations of Marabou certificate checking already exist on top of the state-of-the-art DNN verifier Marabou, they are implemented in C++, and that code itself raises the question of trust (e.g., in the precision of floating point calculations or guarantees for implementation soundness). Here, we present an alternative implementation of the Marabou certificate checking in Imandra -- an industrial functional programming language and an interactive theorem prover (ITP) -- that allows us to obtain full proof of certificate correctness. The significance of the result is two-fold. Firstly, it gives stronger independent guarantees for Marabou proofs. Secondly, it opens the way for the wider adoption of DNN verifiers in interactive theorem proving in the same way as many ITPs already incorporate SMT solvers.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.18957v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The recent work by Shojaee et al. (2025), titled The Illusion of Thinking: Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of Problem Complexity, presents a compelling empirical finding, a reasoning cliff, where the performance of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) collapses beyond a specific complexity threshold, which the authors posit as an intrinsic scaling limitation of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. This commentary, while acknowledging the study's methodological rigor, contends that this conclusion is confounded by experimental artifacts. We argue that the observed failure is not evidence of a fundamental cognitive boundary, but rather a predictable outcome of system-level constraints in the static, text-only evaluation paradigm, including tool use restrictions, context window recall issues, the absence of crucial cognitive baselines, inadequate statistical reporting, and output generation limits. We reframe this performance collapse through the lens of an agentic gap, asserting that the models are not failing at reasoning, but at execution within a profoundly restrictive interface. We empirically substantiate this critique by demonstrating a striking reversal. A model, initially declaring a puzzle impossible when confined to text-only generation, now employs agentic tools to not only solve it but also master variations of complexity far beyond the reasoning cliff it previously failed to surmount. Additionally, our empirical analysis of tool-enabled models like o4-mini and GPT-4o reveals a hierarchy of agentic reasoning, from simple procedural execution to complex meta-cognitive self-correction, which has significant implications for how we define and measure machine intelligence. The illusion of thinking attributed to LRMs is less a reasoning deficit and more a consequence of an otherwise capable mind lacking the tools for action.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.19834v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Sampling low-energy molecular conformations, spatial arrangements of atoms in a molecule, is a critical task for many different calculations performed in the drug discovery and optimization process. Numerous specialized equivariant networks have been designed to generate molecular conformations from 2D molecular graphs. Recently, non-equivariant transformer models have emerged as a viable alternative due to their capability to scale to improve generalization. However, the concern has been that non-equivariant models require a large model size to compensate the lack of equivariant bias. In this paper, we demonstrate that a well-chosen positional encoding effectively addresses these size limitations. A standard transformer model incorporating relative positional encoding for molecular graphs when scaled to 25 million parameters surpasses the current state-of-the-art non-equivariant base model with 64 million parameters on the GEOM-DRUGS benchmark. We implemented relative positional encoding as a negative attention bias that linearly increases with the shortest path distances between graph nodes at varying slopes for different attention heads, similar to ALiBi, a widely adopted relative positional encoding technique in the NLP domain. This architecture has the potential to serve as a foundation for a novel class of generative models for molecular conformations.",

Recently, impressive achievements on AI-based MSFP methods have been reviewed in relevant surveys. However, we observe that the existing surveys have some limitations after a rigorous and detailed investigation. For one thing, most surveys are oriented to a single task or research field, such as 3D object detection or autonomous driving. Therefore, researchers in other related tasks often find it difficult to benefit directly. For another, most surveys only introduce MSFP from a single perspective of multi-modal fusion, while lacking consideration of the diversity of MSFP methods, such as multi-view fusion and time-series fusion. To this end, in this paper, we hope to organize MSFP research from a task-agnostic perspective, where methods are reported from various technical views. Specifically, we first introduce the background of MSFP. Next, we review multi-modal and multi-agent fusion methods. A step further, time-series fusion methods are analyzed. In the era of LLM, we also investigate multimodal LLM fusion methods. Finally, we discuss open challenges and future directions for MSFP.

We present EFTeacher, an AI chatbot powered by the GPT-4-Turbo large language model, designed to generate EFT cues for users with lifestyle-related conditions. To evaluate the feasibility and usability of EFTeacher, we conducted a mixed-methods study that included usability assessments, user evaluations based on content characteristics questionnaires, and semi-structured interviews. Qualitative findings indicate that participants perceived EFTeacher as communicative and supportive through an engaging dialogue. The chatbot facilitated imaginative thinking and reflection on future goals.

In the real world, recommendation systems are driven by user behavior, and since users with the same sensitive feature (e.g., gender and age) tend to have the same patterns, recommendation models can easily capture the strong correlation preference of sensitive features and thus cause recommendation unfairness. Diffusion model (DM) as a new generative model paradigm has achieved great success in recommendation systems. DM's ability to model uncertainty and represent diversity, and its modeling mechanism has a high degree of adaptability with the real-world recommendation process with bias. Therefore, we use DM to effectively model the fairness of recommendation and enhance the diversity. This paper proposes a FairGENerative sequential Recommendation model based on DM, FairGENRec. In the training phase, we inject random noise into the original distribution under the guidance of the sensitive feature recognition model, and a sequential denoise model is designed for the reverse reconstruction of items. Simultaneously, recommendation fairness modeling is completed by injecting multi-interests representational information that eliminates the bias of sensitive user features into the generated results. In the inference phase, the model obtains the noise in the form of noise addition by using the history interactions which is followed by reverse iteration to reconstruct the target item representation. Finally, our extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the dual enhancement effect of FairGENRec on accuracy and fairness, while the statistical analysis of the cases visualizes the degree of improvement on the fairness of the recommendation.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.19399v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Detecting whether a given text is a member of the pre-training data of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for ensuring data privacy and copyright protection. Most existing methods rely on the LLM's hidden information (e.g., model parameters or token probabilities), making them ineffective in the black-box setting, where only input and output texts are accessible. Although some methods have been proposed for the black-box setting, they rely on massive manual efforts such as designing complicated questions or instructions. To address these issues, we propose VeilProbe, the first framework for automatically detecting LLMs' pre-training texts in a black-box setting without human intervention. VeilProbe utilizes a sequence-to-sequence mapping model to infer the latent mapping feature between the input text and the corresponding output suffix generated by the LLM. Then it performs the key token perturbations to obtain more distinguishable membership features. Additionally, considering real-world scenarios where the ground-truth training text samples are limited, a prototype-based membership classifier is introduced to alleviate the overfitting issue.

    "description": "arXiv:2506.18915v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Depression is a common mental illness across current human society. Traditional depression assessment relying on inventories and interviews with psychologists frequently suffer from subjective diagnosis results, slow and expensive diagnosis process as well as lack of human resources. Since there is a solid evidence that depression is reflected by various human internal brain activities and external expressive behaviours, early traditional machine learning (ML) and advanced deep learning (DL) models have been widely explored for human behaviour-based automatic depression assessment (ADA) since 2012. However, recent ADA surveys typically only focus on a limited number of human behaviour modalities. Despite being used as a theoretical basis for developing ADA approaches, existing ADA surveys lack a comprehensive review and summary of multi-modal depression-related human behaviours. To bridge this gap, this paper specifically summarises depression-related human behaviours across a range of modalities (e.g. the human brain, verbal language and non-verbal audio/facial/body behaviours). We focus on conducting an up-to-date and comprehensive survey of ML-based ADA approaches for learning depression cues from these behaviours as well as discussing and comparing their distinctive features and limitations. In addition, we also review existing ADA competitions and datasets, identify and discuss the main challenges and opportunities to provide further research directions for future ADA researchers.",

We explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to convert free-text posologies into structured formats, comparing prompt-based methods and fine-tuning against a 'pre-LLM' system based on Named Entity Recognition and Linking (NERL). Our results show that while prompting improves performance, only fine-tuned LLMs match the accuracy of the baseline. Through error analysis, we observe complementary strengths: NERL offers structural precision, while LLMs better handle semantic nuances. Based on this, we propose a hybrid pipeline that routes low-confidence cases from NERL (<0.8) to the LLM, selecting outputs based on confidence scores.

KGs are used for various applications, including semantic search and discovery, reasoning, decision-making, natural language processing, machine learning, and recommendation systems. Triple (subject-relation-object) extraction from text is the fundamental building block of KG construction and has been widely studied, for example, in early benchmarks such as ACE 2002 to more recent ones, such as WebNLG 2020, REBEL and SynthIE. While the use of LLMs is explored for KG construction, handcrafting reasonable task-specific prompts for LLMs is a labour-intensive exercise and can be brittle due to subtle changes in the LLM models employed. Recent work in NLP tasks (e.g. autonomy generation) uses automatic prompt optimization/engineering to address this challenge by generating optimal or near-optimal task-specific prompts given input-output examples. This empirical study explores the application of automatic prompt optimization for the triple extraction task using experimental benchmarking. We evaluate different settings by changing (a) the prompting strategy, (b) the LLM being used for prompt optimization and task execution, (c) the number of canonical relations in the schema (schema complexity), (d) the length and diversity of input text, (e) the metric used to drive the prompt optimization, and (f) the dataset being used for training and testing. We evaluate three different automatic prompt optimizers, namely, DSPy, APE, and TextGrad and use two different triple extraction datasets, SynthIE and REBEL. Through rigorous empirical evaluation, our main contribution highlights that automatic prompt optimization techniques can generate reasonable prompts similar to humans for triple extraction. In turn, these optimized prompts achieve improved results, particularly with increasing schema complexity and text size.",

This paper explores the ability of LLMs to play the 2D puzzle game Baba is You, in which players manipulate rules by rearranging text blocks that define object properties. Given that this rule-manipulation relies on language abilities and reasoning, it is a compelling challenge for LLMs. Six LLMs are evaluated using different prompt types, including (1) simple, (2) rule-extended and (3) action-extended prompts. In addition, two models (Mistral, OLMo) are finetuned using textual and structural data from the game. Results show that while larger models (particularly GPT-4o) perform better in reasoning and puzzle solving, smaller unadapted models struggle to recognize game mechanics or apply rule changes. Finetuning improves the ability to analyze the game levels, but does not significantly improve solution formulation. We conclude that even for state-of-the-art and finetuned LLMs, reasoning about dynamic rule changes is difficult (specifically, understanding the use-mention distinction).

Existing prompt learning methods face two main limitations: 1) they primarily focus on class-incremental learning scenarios, lacking specific strategies for multi-domain task incremental learning; 2) most current approaches employ single-modal prompts, neglecting the potential benefits of cross-modal information exchange. To address these challenges, we propose the ChordPrompt framework, which facilitates a harmonious interplay between visual and textual prompts. ChordPrompt introduces cross-modal prompts to leverage interactions between visual and textual information. Our approach also employs domain-adaptive text prompts to select appropriate prompts for continual adaptation across multiple domains.

While vision-language models like CLIP show great promise, they struggle to maintain performance across domains in incremental learning scenarios. Existing prompt learning methods face two main limitations: 1) they primarily focus on class-incremental learning scenarios, lacking specific strategies for multi-domain task incremental learning; 2) most current approaches employ single-modal prompts, neglecting the potential benefits of cross-modal information exchange. To address these challenges, we propose the ChordPrompt framework, which facilitates a harmonious interplay between visual and textual prompts. ChordPrompt introduces cross-modal prompts to leverage interactions between visual and textual information. Our approach also employs domain-adaptive text prompts to select appropriate prompts for continual adaptation across multiple domains. Comprehensive experiments on multi-domain incremental learning benchmarks demonstrate that ChordPrompt outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot generalization and downstream task performance.",

Current state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o, Qwen-VL, and LLaVA 1.6 struggle with tasks such as precise color identification and spatial localization, resulting in inaccurate or incomplete interpretations. To address these challenges, we introduce Sparse Position and Outline Tracking (SPOT), a novel algorithm specifically designed to process irregularly shaped colored regions in visual data. SPOT identifies and localizes these regions by extracting their spatial coordinates, enabling structured representations of irregular shapes. Building on SPOT, we construct ClimateIQA, a novel meteorological visual question answering (VQA) dataset, comprising 26,280 high-resolution heatmaps and 762,120 instruction samples for wind gust, total precipitation, wind chill index and heat index analysis. ClimateIQA enhances VLM training by incorporating spatial cues, geographic metadata, and reanalysis data, improving model accuracy in interpreting and describing extreme weather features. Furthermore, we develop Climate-Zoo, a suite of fine-tuned VLMs based on SPOT-empowered ClimateIQA, which significantly outperforms existing models in meteorological heatmap tasks.",

Although large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on many downstream NLP tasks, growing evidence suggests that they struggle with sarcasm understanding. In this paper, we propose Commander-GPT, a modular decision routing framework inspired by military command theory. Rather than relying on a single LLM's capability, Commander-GPT orchestrates a team of specialized LLM agents where each agent will be selectively assigned to a focused sub-task such as context modeling, sentiment analysis, etc. Their outputs are then routed back to the commander, which integrates the information and performs the final sarcasm judgment. To coordinate these agents, we introduce three types of centralized commanders: (1) a trained lightweight encoder-based commander (e.g., multi-modal BERT); (2) four small autoregressive language models, serving as moderately capable commanders (e.g., DeepSeek-VL); (3) two large LLM-based commander (Gemini Pro and GPT-4o) that performs task routing, output aggregation, and sarcasm decision-making in a zero-shot fashion. We evaluate Commander-GPT on the MMSD and MMSD 2.0 benchmarks, comparing five prompting strategies. Experimental results show that our framework achieves 4.4% and 11.7% improvement in F1 score over state-of-the-art (SoTA) baselines on average, demonstrating its effectiveness.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.18924v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: We present an enhanced YOLOv8 real time vehicle detection and classification framework, for estimating carbon emissions in urban environments. The system enhances YOLOv8 architecture to detect, segment, and track vehicles from live traffic video streams. Once a vehicle is localized, a dedicated deep learning-based identification module is employed to recognize license plates and classify vehicle types. Since YOLOv8 lacks the built-in capacity for fine grained recognition tasks such as reading license plates or determining vehicle attributes beyond class labels, our framework incorporates a hybrid pipeline where each detected vehicle is tracked and its bounding box is cropped and passed to a deep Optical Character Recognition (OCR) module. This OCR system, composed of multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) layers, is trained specifically for character-level detection and license plate decoding under varied conditions such as motion blur, occlusion, and diverse font styles. Additionally, the recognized plate information is validated using a real time API that cross references with an external vehicle registration database to ensure accurate classification and emission estimation. This multi-stage approach enables precise, automated calculation of per vehicle carbon emissions. Extensive evaluation was conducted using a diverse vehicle dataset enriched with segmentation masks and annotated license plates. The YOLOv8 detector achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of approximately 71% for bounding boxes and 70% for segmentation masks. Character level OCR accuracy reached up to 99% with the best performing CNN model. These results affirm the feasibility of combining real time object detection with deep OCR for practical deployment in smart transportation systems, offering a scalable solution for automated, vehicle specific carbon emission monitoring.",

In this paper, we propose Controllable Video Generative Adversarial Networks (CoVoGAN) to disentangle the video concepts, thus facilitating efficient and independent control over individual concepts.

To establish the theoretical foundation, we provide a rigorous analysis demonstrating the identifiability of our approach. Building on these theoretical insights, we design a Temporal Transition Module to disentangle latent dynamics.

This growing risk highlights the urgent need for a real-world benchmark to evaluate the ability of LLM agents to exploit web application vulnerabilities. However, existing benchmarks fall short as they are limited to abstracted Capture the Flag competitions or lack comprehensive coverage. Building a benchmark for real-world vulnerabilities involves both specialized expertise to reproduce exploits and a systematic approach to evaluating unpredictable threats. To address this challenge, we introduce CVE-Bench, a real-world cybersecurity benchmark based on critical-severity Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. In CVE-Bench, we design a sandbox framework that enables LLM agents to exploit vulnerable web applications in scenarios that mimic real-world conditions, while also providing effective evaluation of their exploits. Our evaluation shows that the state-of-the-art agent framework can resolve up to 13% of vulnerabilities.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.18939v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Training urban spatio-temporal foundation models that generalize well across diverse regions and cities is critical for deploying urban services in unseen or data-scarce regions. Recent studies have typically focused on fusing cross-domain spatio-temporal data to train unified Transformer-based models. However, these models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high memory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment. Inspired by the efficiency of Mamba, a state space model with linear time complexity, we explore its potential for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. However, directly applying Mamba as a spatio-temporal backbone leads to negative transfer and severe performance degradation. This is primarily due to spatio-temporal heterogeneity and the recursive mechanism of Mamba's hidden state updates, which limit cross-domain generalization. To overcome these challenges, we propose Damba-ST, a novel domain-adaptive Mamba-based model for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. Damba-ST retains Mamba's linear complexity advantage while significantly enhancing its adaptability to heterogeneous domains. Specifically, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a domain-adaptive state space model that partitions the latent representation space into a shared subspace for learning cross-domain commonalities and independent, domain-specific subspaces for capturing intra-domain discriminative features; (2) three distinct Domain Adapters, which serve as domain-aware proxies to bridge disparate domain distributions and facilitate the alignment of cross-domain commonalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generalization and efficiency of Damba-ST. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on prediction tasks and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, enabling seamless deployment in new urban environments without extensive retraining or fine-tuning.",

The task of distinguishing LLM-authored texts is complicated by the nuanced and overlapping behaviors of both machines and humans. In this paper, we challenge the current practice of considering LLM-generated text detection a binary classification task of differentiating human from AI. Instead, we introduce a novel ternary text classification scheme, adding an 'undecided' category for texts that could be attributed to either source, and we show that this new category is crucial to understand how to make the detection result more explainable to lay users. This research shifts the paradigm from merely classifying to explaining machine-generated texts, emphasizing need for detectors to provide clear and understandable explanations to users. Our study involves creating four new datasets comprised of texts from various LLMs and human authors. Based on new datasets, we performed binary classification tests to ascertain the most effective SOTA detection methods and identified SOTA LLMs capable of producing harder-to-detect texts. We constructed a new dataset of texts generated by two top-performing LLMs and human authors, and asked three human annotators to produce ternary labels with explanation notes. This dataset was used to investigate how three top-performing SOTA detectors behave in new ternary classification context. Our results highlight why 'undecided' category is much needed from the viewpoint of explainability.

This article provides a comprehensive review of how LLM-based conversational agents are being used in higher education, with extensions to secondary and lifelong learning contexts. We synthesize existing literature on LLMs in education and theories of conversational and dialogic pedagogy - including Vygotsky's sociocultural learning (scaffolding and the Zone of Proximal Development), the Socratic method, and Laurillard's conversational framework - and examine how prompting strategies and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can align LLM behaviors with these pedagogical theories, and how it can support personalized, adaptive learning. We map educational theories to LLM capabilities, highlighting where LLM-driven dialogue supports established learning principles and where it challenges or falls short of traditional pedagogical assumptions. Notable gaps in applying prior theories to LLMs are identified, such as the models tendency to provide direct answers instead of fostering co-construction of knowledge, and the need to account for the constant availability and broad but non-human expertise of LLM tutors. In response, we propose practical strategies to better align LLM interactions with sound pedagogy - for example, designing prompts that encourage Socratic questioning, scaffolded guidance, and student reflection, as well as integrating retrieval mechanisms to ensure accuracy and contextual relevance.

We address this by separating 11 biomedical QA benchmarks into reasoning- and knowledge-focused subsets using a PubMedBERT classifier that reaches 81 percent accuracy, comparable to human performance. Our analysis shows that only 32.8 percent of questions require complex reasoning. We evaluate biomedical models (HuatuoGPT-o1, MedReason, m1) and general-domain models (DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini, Qwen3), finding consistent gaps between knowledge and reasoning performance. For example, HuatuoGPT-o1 scores 56.9 on knowledge but only 44.8 on reasoning. In adversarial tests where models are misled with incorrect initial reasoning, biomedical models degrade sharply, while larger or RL-trained general models show more robustness. To address this, we train BioMed-R1 using fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on reasoning-heavy examples. It achieves the strongest performance among similarly sized models.

We address this by separating 11 biomedical QA benchmarks into reasoning- and knowledge-focused subsets using a PubMedBERT classifier that reaches 81 percent accuracy, comparable to human performance. Our analysis shows that only 32.8 percent of questions require complex reasoning. We evaluate biomedical models (HuatuoGPT-o1, MedReason, m1) and general-domain models (DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini, Qwen3), finding consistent gaps between knowledge and reasoning performance. For example, HuatuoGPT-o1 scores 56.9 on knowledge but only 44.8 on reasoning. In adversarial tests where models are misled with incorrect initial reasoning, biomedical models degrade sharply, while larger or RL-trained general models show more robustness. To address this, we train BioMed-R1 using fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on reasoning-heavy examples. It achieves the strongest performance among similarly sized models. Further gains may come from incorporating clinical case reports and training with adversarial and backtracking scenarios.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.18928v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Strategic randomization is a key principle in game theory, yet it remains underexplored in large language models (LLMs). Prior work often conflates the cognitive decision to randomize with the mechanical generation of randomness, leading to incomplete evaluations. To address this, we propose a novel zero-sum game inspired by the Tian Ji Horse Race, where the Nash equilibrium corresponds to a maximal entropy strategy. The game's complexity masks this property from untrained humans and underdeveloped LLMs. We evaluate five LLMs across prompt styles -- framed, neutral, and hinted -- using competitive multi-tournament gameplay with system-provided random choices, isolating the decision to randomize. Results show that weaker models remain deterministic regardless of prompts, while stronger models exhibit increased randomization under explicit hints. When facing weaker models, strong LLMs adopt deterministic strategies to exploit biases, but converge toward equilibrium play when facing peers. Through win/loss outcomes and Bayes factor analysis, we demonstrate meaningful variation in LLMs' strategic reasoning capabilities, highlighting opportunities for improvement in abstract reasoning and adaptive learning. We make our implementation publicly available at https://github.com/ocelopus/llm-when-to-throw-coin to ensure full reproducibility.",

    "description": "arXiv:2410.21719v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Evaluating the diversity of generative models without reference data poses methodological challenges. The reference-free Vendi and RKE scores address this by quantifying the diversity of generated data using matrix-based entropy measures. Among these two, the Vendi score is typically computed via the eigendecomposition of an $n times n$ kernel matrix constructed from n generated samples. However, the prohibitive computational cost of eigendecomposition for large $n$ often limits the number of samples used to fewer than 20,000. In this paper, we investigate the statistical convergence of the Vendi and RKE scores under restricted sample sizes. We numerically demonstrate that, in general, the Vendi score computed with standard sample sizes below 20,000 may not converge to its asymptotic value under infinite sampling. To address this, we introduce the $t$-truncated Vendi score by truncating the eigenspectrum of the kernel matrix, which is provably guaranteed to converge to its population limit with $n=mathcal{O}(t)$ samples. We further show that existing Nystr'om and FKEA approximation methods converge to the asymptotic limit of the truncated Vendi score. In contrast to the Vendi score, we prove that the RKE score enjoys universal convergence guarantees across all kernel functions. We conduct several numerical experiments to illustrate the concentration of Nystr'om and FKEA computed Vendi scores around the truncated Vendi score, and we analyze how the truncated Vendi and RKE scores correlate with the diversity of image and text data.

OMI is a severe form of heart attack characterized by complete blockage of one or more coronary arteries requiring immediate referral for cardiac catheterization to restore blood flow to the heart. Two thirds of OMI cases are difficult to visually identify from a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and can be potentially fatal if not identified quickly. Previous works on this topic are scarce, and current state-of-the-art evidence suggests both feature-based random forests and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are promising approaches to improve ECG detection of OMI. Methods: While the ResNet architecture has been adapted for use with ECG recordings, it is not ideally suited to capture informative temporal features within each lead and the spatial concordance or discordance across leads. We propose a clinically informed modification of the ResNet-18 architecture. The model first learns temporal features through temporal convolutional layers with 1xk kernels followed by a spatial convolutional layer, after the residual blocks, with 12x1 kernels to learn spatial features. Results: ECG-SMART-NET was benchmarked against the original ResNet-18 and other state-of-the-art models on a multisite real-word clinical dataset that consists of 10,393 ECGs from 7,397 unique patients (rate of OMI =7.2%). ECG-SMART-NET outperformed other models in the classification of OMI with a test AUC of 0.953 [0.921, 0.978].

Unlike traditional benchmarks primarily focused on prediction accuracy, REACT emphasizes transparent and interpretable reasoning, requiring models to align their logic closely with expert-derived procedures. To assess whether LLM reasoning aligns closely with human experts, we annotated 511 clinical cases from the medical domain and 86 legal cases from the legal domain, each enriched with detailed expert-extracted rationales and evidence supporting each step of the reasoning process. These annotations were guided by carefully constructed reasoning graphs, which explicitly encode domain-specific inference structures and decision criteria derived by domain experts. These reasoning graphs serve not only as standards for expert annotation but also as structured guidelines enabling models to reason transparently and step-by-step. To address the scalability challenges of manual annotation, we further developed a semi-automatic annotation pipeline leveraging expert-defined reasoning graph templates to efficiently generate new graphs, exploring the potential to extend our approach into additional critical domains. Experimental results demonstrate that reasoning graphs substantially enhance the interpretability and accuracy of LLM reasoning compared to traditional baselines, although significant gaps remain relative to expert-level reasoning performance.",

However, the performance of existing NCD methods could be severely compromised when novel classes are sampled from a different distribution with the labeled ones. In this paper, we explore and establish the solvability of NCD with cross domain setting under the necessary condition that the style information needs to be removed. Based on the theoretical analysis, we introduce an exclusive style removal module for extracting style information that is distinctive from the baseline features, thereby facilitating inference. Moreover, this module is easy to integrate with other NCD methods, acting as a plug-in to improve performance on novel classes with different distributions compared to the labeled set. Additionally, recognizing the non-negligible influence of different backbones and pre-training strategies on the performance of the NCD methods, we build a fair benchmark for future NCD research.

However, this trend introduces distinct challenges, particularly in terms of flight dynamics and power consumption, which limit the UAVs' autonomy and mission capabilities. This paper presents a novel approach to overcoming these limitations by integrating Neural 3D Reconstruction (N3DR) with small UAV systems for fine-grained 3-Dimensional (3D) digital reconstruction of small static objects. Specifically, we design, implement, and evaluate an N3DR-based pipeline that leverages advanced models, i.e., Instant-ngp, Nerfacto, and Splatfacto, to improve the quality of 3D reconstructions using images of the object captured by a fleet of small UAVs. We assess the performance of the considered models using various imagery and pointcloud metrics, comparing them against the baseline Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that the N3DR-enhanced pipeline significantly improves reconstruction quality, making it feasible for small UAVs to support high-precision 3D mapping and anomaly detection in constrained environments.

Meanwhile, the TSM is trained to capture diverse local dynamics through multiple functional regions, each of which learns specific features from individual tasks. During testing phase, the RM dynamically selects the most relevant functional region from the TSM based on input sequence features, which is then combined with the generalized knowledge learned by the GKM to generate accurate forecasts. This design enables FAF to achieve robust and personalized forecasting even with sparse historical observations We evaluate FAF on five diverse real-world datasets under few-shot time series forecasting settings.

    "title": "Finding Clustering Algorithms in the Transformer Architecture",
    "description": "arXiv:2506.19125v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The invention of the transformer architecture has revolutionized Artificial Intelligence (AI), yielding unprecedented success in areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal reasoning. Despite these advances, it is unclear whether transformers are able to learn and implement precise algorithms. Here, we demonstrate that transformers can exactly implement a fundamental and widely used algorithm for $k$-means clustering: Lloyd's algorithm. First, we theoretically prove the existence of such a transformer architecture, which we term the $k$-means transformer, that exactly implements Lloyd's algorithm for $k$-means clustering using the standard ingredients of modern transformers: attention and residual connections. Next, we numerically implement this transformer and demonstrate in experiments the exact correspondence between our architecture and Lloyd's algorithm, providing a fully neural implementation of $k$-means clustering. Finally, we demonstrate that interpretable alterations (e.g., incorporating layer normalizations or multilayer perceptrons) to this architecture yields diverse and novel variants of clustering algorithms, such as soft $k$-means, spherical $k$-means, trimmed $k$-means, and more. Collectively, our findings demonstrate how transformer mechanisms can precisely map onto algorithmic procedures, offering a clear and interpretable perspective on implementing precise algorithms in transformers.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.19358v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG), as a crucial find-grained cardiac feature, has been successfully recovered from radar signals in the literature, but the performance heavily relies on the high-quality radar signal and numerous radar-ECG pairs for training, restricting the applications in new scenarios due to data scarcity. Therefore, this work will focus on radar-based ECG recovery in new scenarios with limited data and propose a cardio-focusing and -tracking (CFT) algorithm to precisely track the cardiac location to ensure an efficient acquisition of high-quality radar signals. Furthermore, a transfer learning model (RFcardi) is proposed to extract cardio-related information from the radar signal without ECG ground truth based on the intrinsic sparsity of cardiac features, and only a few synchronous radar-ECG pairs are required to fine-tune the pre-trained model for the ECG recovery. The experimental results reveal that the proposed CFT can dynamically identify the cardiac location, and the RFcardi model can effectively generate faithful ECG recoveries after using a small number of radar-ECG pairs for training. The code and dataset are available after the publication.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.19686v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Humans and animals show remarkable learning efficiency, adapting to new environments with minimal experience. This capability is not well captured by standard reinforcement learning algorithms that rely on incremental value updates. Rapid adaptation likely depends on episodic memory -- the ability to retrieve specific past experiences to guide decisions in novel contexts. Transformers provide a useful setting for studying these questions because of their ability to learn rapidly in-context and because their key-value architecture resembles episodic memory systems in the brain. We train a transformer to in-context reinforcement learn in a distribution of planning tasks inspired by rodent behavior. We then characterize the learning algorithms that emerge in the model. We first find that representation learning is supported by in-context structure learning and cross-context alignment, where representations are aligned across environments with different sensory stimuli. We next demonstrate that the reinforcement learning strategies developed by the model are not interpretable as standard model-free or model-based planning. Instead, we show that in-context reinforcement learning is supported by caching intermediate computations within the model's memory tokens, which are then accessed at decision time. Overall, we find that memory may serve as a computational resource, storing both raw experience and cached computations to support flexible behavior. Furthermore, the representations developed in the model resemble computations associated with the hippocampal-entorhinal system in the brain, suggesting that our findings may be relevant for natural cognition. Taken together, our work offers a mechanistic hypothesis for the rapid adaptation that underlies in-context learning in artificial and natural settings.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.19724v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Recent progress in autonomous code generation has fueled excitement around AI agents capable of accelerating scientific discovery by running experiments. However, there is currently no benchmark that evaluates whether such agents can implement scientific ideas when given varied amounts of code as a starting point, interpolating between reproduction (running code) and from-scratch replication (fully re-implementing and running code). We introduce AutoExperiment, a benchmark that evaluates AI agents' ability to implement and run machine learning experiments based on natural language descriptions in research papers. In each task, agents are given a research paper, a codebase with key functions masked out, and a command to run the experiment. The goal is to generate the missing code, execute the experiment in a sandboxed environment, and reproduce the results. AutoExperiment scales in difficulty by varying the number of missing functions $n$, ranging from partial reproduction to full replication. We evaluate state-of-the-art agents and find that performance degrades rapidly as $n$ increases. Agents that can dynamically interact with the environment (e.g. to debug their code) can outperform agents in fixed 'agentless' harnesses, and there exists a significant gap between single-shot and multi-trial success rates (Pass@1 vs. Pass@5), motivating verifier approaches to our benchmark. Our findings highlight critical challenges in long-horizon code generation, context retrieval, and autonomous experiment execution, establishing AutoExperiment as a new benchmark for evaluating progress in AI-driven scientific experimentation.

TabPFN has recently demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional machine learning (ML) models in various regression and classification tasks. We used the dekadal (10-days) time series of Earth Observation (EO; FAPAR and soil moisture) and gridded weather data (air temperature, precipitation and radiation) to forecast the yield of summer crops at the sub-national level. The crop yield data was available for 23 years and for up to 8 provinces. Covariate variables for TabPFN (i.e., EO and weather) were extracted by region and aggregated at a monthly scale. We benchmarked the results of the TabPFN against six ML models and three baseline models. Leave-one-year-out cross-validation experiment setting was used in order to ensure the assessment of the models capacity to forecast an unseen year. Results showed that TabPFN and ML models exhibit comparable accuracy, outperforming the baselines. Nonetheless, TabPFN demonstrated superior practical utility due to its significantly faster tuning time and reduced requirement for feature engineering. This renders TabPFN a more viable option for real-world operation yield forecasting applications, where efficiency and ease of implementation are paramount.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.19224v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The objective of graph coarsening is to generate smaller, more manageable graphs while preserving key information of the original graph. Previous work were mainly based on the perspective of spectrum-preserving, using some predefined coarsening rules to make the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of the original graph and the coarsened graph match as much as possible. However, they largely overlooked the fact that the original graph is composed of subregions at different levels of granularity, where highly connected and similar nodes should be more inclined to be aggregated together as nodes in the coarsened graph. By combining the multi-granularity characteristics of the graph structure, we can generate coarsened graph at the optimal granularity. To this end, inspired by the application of granular-ball computing in multi-granularity, we propose a new multi-granularity, efficient, and adaptive coarsening method via granular-ball (GBGC), which significantly improves the coarsening results and efficiency. Specifically, GBGC introduces an adaptive granular-ball graph refinement mechanism, which adaptively splits the original graph from coarse to fine into granular-balls of different sizes and optimal granularity, and constructs the coarsened graph using these granular-balls as supernodes. In addition, compared with other state-of-the-art graph coarsening methods, the processing speed of this method can be increased by tens to hundreds of times and has lower time complexity. The accuracy of GBGC is almost always higher than that of the original graph due to the good robustness and generalization of the granular-ball computing, so it has the potential to become a standard graph data preprocessing method.",

And, if a custom model is pretrained, are novel methods required? In this paper we explore these questions by conducting a case-study, in which we train a foundation model on a large regional fetal ultrasound dataset of 2M images. By selecting the well-established DINOv2 method for pretraining, we achieve state-of-the-art results on three fetal ultrasound datasets, covering data from different countries, classification, segmentation, and few-shot tasks. We compare against a series of models pretrained on natural images, ultrasound images, and supervised baselines. Our results demonstrate two key insights: (i) Pretraining on custom data is worth it, even if smaller models are trained on less data, as scaling in natural image pretraining does not translate to ultrasound performance. (ii) Well-tuned methods from computer vision are making it feasible to train custom foundation models for a given medical domain, requiring no hyperparameter tuning and little methodological adaptation. Given these findings, we argue that a bias towards methodological innovation should be avoided when developing domain specific foundation models under common computational resource constraints.",

To address this challenge, we propose HAWAII, a novel framework that distills knowledge from multiple visual experts into a single vision encoder, enabling it to inherit the complementary strengths of several experts with minimal computational overhead. To mitigate conflicts among different teachers and switch between different teacher-specific knowledge, instead of using a fixed set of adapters for multiple teachers, we propose to use teacher-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters with a corresponding router. Each adapter is aligned with a specific teacher, avoiding noisy guidance during distillation. To enable efficient knowledge distillation, we propose fine-grained and coarse-grained distillation. At the fine-grained level, token importance scores are employed to emphasize the most informative tokens from each teacher adaptively. At the coarse-grained level, we summarize the knowledge from multiple teachers and transfer it to the student using a set of general-knowledge LoRA adapters with a router. Extensive experiments on various vision-language tasks demonstrate the superiority of HAWAII, compared to the popular open-source VLMs.",

We introduce textbf{HeurAgenix}, a two-stage hyper-heuristic framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that first evolves heuristics and then selects among them automatically. In the heuristic evolution phase, HeurAgenix leverages an LLM to compare seed heuristic solutions with higher-quality solutions and extract reusable evolution strategies. During problem solving, it dynamically picks the most promising heuristic for each problem state, guided by the LLM's perception ability. For flexibility, this selector can be either a state-of-the-art LLM or a fine-tuned lightweight model with lower inference cost. To mitigate the scarcity of reliable supervision caused by CO complexity, we fine-tune the lightweight heuristic selector with a dual-reward mechanism that jointly exploits singals from selection preferences and state perception, enabling robust selection under noisy annotations. Extensive experiments on canonical benchmarks show that HeurAgenix not only outperforms existing LLM-based hyper-heuristics but also matches or exceeds specialized solvers.

However, in many real-world applications, especially in high-dimensional setting, constructing a fully specified ADMG is often infeasible. This limitation has led to growing interest in partially specified causal representations, particularly through cluster-directed mixed graphs (C-DMGs), which group variables into clusters and offer a more abstract yet practical view of causal dependencies. While these representations can include cycles, recent work has shown that the do-calculus remains sound and complete for identifying macro-level causal effects in C-DMGs over ADMGs under the assumption that all clusters size are greater than 1. Nevertheless, real-world systems often exhibit cyclic causal dynamics at the structural level. To account for this, input-output structural causal models (ioSCMs) have been introduced as a generalization of SCMs that allow for cycles. ioSCMs induce another type of graph structure known as a directed mixed graph (DMG). Analogous to the ADMG setting, one can define C-DMGs over DMGs as high-level representations of causal relations among clusters of variables. In this paper, we prove that, unlike in the ADMG setting, the do-calculus is unconditionally sound and complete for identifying macro causal effects in C-DMGs over DMGs.

We first proposed pedagogical prompting, a theoretically-grounded new concept to elicit learning-oriented responses from LLMs. To move from concept design to a proof-of-concept learning intervention in real educational settings, we selected early undergraduate CS education (CS1/CS2) as the example context. We began with a formative survey study with instructors (N=36) teaching early-stage undergraduate-level CS courses to inform the instructional design based on classroom needs. Based on their insights, we designed and developed a learning intervention through an interactive system with scenario-based instruction to train pedagogical prompting skills. Finally, we evaluated its instructional effectiveness through a user study with CS novice students (N=22) using pre/post-tests. Through mixed methods analyses, our results indicate significant improvements in learners' LLM-based pedagogical help-seeking skills, along with positive attitudes toward the system and increased willingness to use pedagogical prompts in the future. Our contributions include (1) a theoretical framework of pedagogical prompting; (2) empirical insights into current instructor attitudes toward pedagogical prompting; and (3) a learning intervention design with an interactive learning tool and scenario-based instruction leading to promising results on teaching LLM-based help-seeking.

    "title": "Interpretable and Granular Video-Based Quantification of Motor Characteristics from the Finger Tapping Test in Parkinson Disease",
    "description": "arXiv:2506.18925v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Accurately quantifying motor characteristics in Parkinson disease (PD) is crucial for monitoring disease progression and optimizing treatment strategies. The finger-tapping test is a standard motor assessment. Clinicians visually evaluate a patient's tapping performance and assign an overall severity score based on tapping amplitude, speed, and irregularity. However, this subjective evaluation is prone to inter- and intra-rater variability, and does not offer insights into individual motor characteristics captured during this test. This paper introduces a granular computer vision-based method for quantifying PD motor characteristics from video recordings. Four sets of clinically relevant features are proposed to characterize hypokinesia, bradykinesia, sequence effect, and hesitation-halts. We evaluate our approach on video recordings and clinical evaluations of 74 PD patients from the Personalized Parkinson Project. Principal component analysis with varimax rotation shows that the video-based features corresponded to the four deficits. Additionally, video-based analysis has allowed us to identify further granular distinctions within sequence effect and hesitation-halts deficits. In the following, we have used these features to train machine learning classifiers to estimate the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) finger-tapping score. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our method achieves a higher accuracy in MDS-UPDRS score prediction, while still providing an interpretable quantification of individual finger-tapping motor characteristics. In summary, the proposed framework provides a practical solution for the objective assessment of PD motor characteristics, that can potentially be applied in both clinical and remote settings. Future work is needed to assess its responsiveness to symptomatic treatment and disease progression.",

Robotic manipulation tasks generally involve multi-object environments with potential inter-object interaction. We thus argue that they are a very interesting playground to really evaluate the potential of existing object-centric work. To do so, we create several robotic manipulation tasks in simulated environments involving multiple objects (several distractors, the robot, etc.) and a high-level of randomization (object positions, colors, shapes, background, initial positions, etc.). We then evaluate one classical object-centric method across several generalization scenarios and compare its results against several state-of-the-art hollistic representations.

    "description": "arXiv:2502.17036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Language model (LM) re-rankers are used to refine retrieval results for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). They are more expensive than lexical matching methods like BM25 but assumed to better process semantic information and the relations between the query and the retrieved answers. To understand whether LM re-rankers always live up to this assumption, we evaluate 6 different LM re-rankers on the NQ, LitQA2 and DRUID datasets. Our results show that LM re-rankers struggle to outperform a simple BM25 baseline on DRUID. Leveraging a novel separation metric based on BM25 scores, we explain and identify re-ranker errors stemming from lexical dissimilarities. We also investigate different methods to improve LM re-ranker performance and find these methods mainly useful for NQ. Taken together, our work identifies and explains weaknesses of LM re-rankers and points to the need for more adversarial and realistic datasets for their evaluation.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.19089v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: We introduce $texttt{StorySim}$, a programmable framework for synthetically generating stories to evaluate the theory of mind (ToM) and world modeling (WM) capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior benchmarks that may suffer from contamination in pretraining data, $texttt{StorySim}$ produces novel, compositional story prompts anchored by a highly controllable $texttt{Storyboard}$, enabling precise manipulation of character perspectives and events. We use this framework to design first- and second-order ToM tasks alongside WM tasks that control for the ability to track and model mental states. Our experiments across a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that most models perform better on WM tasks than ToM tasks, and that models tend to perform better reasoning with humans compared to inanimate objects. Additionally, our framework enabled us to find evidence of heuristic behavior such as recency bias and an over-reliance on earlier events in the story.

    "title": "MambaOutRS: A Hybrid CNN-Fourier Architecture for Remote Sensing Image Classification",
    "description": "arXiv:2506.19561v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning for vision tasks have seen the rise of State Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba, celebrated for their linear scalability. However, their adaptation to 2D visual data often necessitates complex modifications that may diminish efficiency. In this paper, we introduce MambaOutRS, a novel hybrid convolutional architecture for remote sensing image classification that re-evaluates the necessity of recurrent SSMs. MambaOutRS builds upon stacked Gated CNN blocks for local feature extraction and introduces a novel Fourier Filter Gate (FFG) module that operates in the frequency domain to capture global contextual information efficiently. Our architecture employs a four-stage hierarchical design and was extensively evaluated on challenging remote sensing datasets: UC Merced, AID, NWPU-RESISC45, and EuroSAT. MambaOutRS consistently achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across these benchmarks. Notably, our MambaOutRS-t variant (24.0M parameters) attained the highest F1-scores of 98.41% on UC Merced and 95.99% on AID, significantly outperforming existing baselines, including larger transformer models and Mamba-based architectures, despite using considerably fewer parameters. An ablation study conclusively demonstrates the critical role of the Fourier Filter Gate in enhancing the model's ability to capture global spatial patterns, leading to robust and accurate classification. These results strongly suggest that the complexities of recurrent SSMs can be effectively superseded by a judicious combination of gated convolutions for spatial mixing and frequency-based gates for spectral global context. Thus, MambaOutRS provides a compelling and efficient paradigm for developing high-performance deep learning models in remote sensing and other vision domains, particularly where computational efficiency is paramount.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.19502v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Accessibility remains a critical concern in today's society, as many technologies are not developed to support the full range of user needs. Existing multi-agent systems (MAS) often cannot provide comprehensive assistance for users in need due to the lack of customization stemming from closed-source designs. Consequently, individuals with disabilities frequently encounter significant barriers when attempting to interact with digital environments. We introduce MATE, a multimodal accessibility MAS, which performs the modality conversions based on the user's needs. The system is useful for assisting people with disabilities by ensuring that data will be converted to an understandable format. For instance, if the user cannot see well and receives an image, the system converts this image to its audio description. MATE can be applied to a wide range of domains, industries, and areas, such as healthcare, and can become a useful assistant for various groups of users. The system supports multiple types of models, ranging from LLM API calling to using custom machine learning (ML) classifiers. This flexibility ensures that the system can be adapted to various needs and is compatible with a wide variety of hardware. Since the system is expected to run locally, it ensures the privacy and security of sensitive information. In addition, the framework can be effectively integrated with institutional technologies (e.g., digital healthcare service) for real-time user assistance. Furthermore, we introduce ModCon-Task-Identifier, a model that is capable of extracting the precise modality conversion task from the user input. Numerous experiments show that ModCon-Task-Identifier consistently outperforms other LLMs and statistical models on our custom data.

We introduce MCP-Zero, an active agent framework that restores tool discovery autonomy to LLMs themselves. Instead of overwhelming models with all available tools, MCP-Zero enables agents to actively identify capability gaps, and request specific tools on-demand, transforming them from large-scale retrievers into genuine autonomous agents. The framework operates through three core mechanisms: (1) Active Tool Request, where models autonomously generate structured requests specifying their exact tool requirements; (2) Hierarchical Semantic Routing, a two-stage algorithm that matches requests to relevant servers and tools through improved semantic alignment; (3) Iterative Capability Extension, enabling agents to progressively build cross-domain toolchains while maintaining minimal context footprint. We construct MCP-tools, a comprehensive dataset of 308 MCP servers and 2,797 tools from the official Model-Context-Protocol repository. Experiments demonstrate that MCP-Zero preserves agent autonomy while achieving substantial efficiency gains: (i) accurate tool selection from nearly 3k candidates across 248.1k tokens; (ii) 98% reduction in token consumption on APIBank while maintaining high accuracy; and (iii) consistent multi-turn performance that scales with tool ecosystem growth.

We introduce textbf{Mem4Nav}, a hierarchical spatial-cognition long-short memory system that can augment any VLN backbone. Mem4Nav fuses a sparse octree for fine-grained voxel indexing with a semantic topology graph for high-level landmark connectivity, storing both in trainable memory tokens embedded via a reversible Transformer. Long-term memory (LTM) compresses and retains historical observations at both octree and graph nodes, while short-term memory (STM) caches recent multimodal entries in relative coordinates for real-time obstacle avoidance and local planning. At each step, STM retrieval sharply prunes dynamic context, and, when deeper history is needed, LTM tokens are decoded losslessly to reconstruct past embeddings. Evaluated on Touchdown and Map2Seq across three backbones (modular, state-of-the-art VLN with prompt-based LLM, and state-of-the-art VLN with strided-attention MLLM), Mem4Nav yields 7-13 pp gains in Task Completion, sufficient SPD reduction, and >10 pp nDTW improvement.

Since healthcare data is private, sensitive, and heterogeneous, collecting sufficient data for modelling is exhausting, costly, and sometimes impossible. In this paper, we propose a framework for global healthcare modelling using datasets from multi-continents (Europe, North America, and Asia) without sharing the local datasets, and choose glucose management as a study model to verify its effectiveness. Technically, blockchain-enabled federated learning is implemented with adaptation to meet the privacy and safety requirements of healthcare data, meanwhile, it rewards honest participation and penalizes malicious activities using its on-chain incentive mechanism. Experimental results show that the proposed framework is effective, efficient, and privacy-preserving. Its prediction accuracy consistently outperforms models trained on limited personal data and achieves comparable or even slightly better results than centralized training in certain scenarios, all while preserving data privacy. This work paves the way for international collaborations on healthcare projects, where additional data is crucial for reducing bias and providing benefits to humanity.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.19500v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: LLMs' reliance on static knowledge and fragile tool invocation severely hinders the orchestration of complex, heterogeneous toolchains, particularly at large scales. Existing methods typically use rigid single-path execution, resulting in poor error recovery and exponentially growing search spaces. We introduce NaviAgent, a graph-navigated bilevel planning architecture for robust function calling, comprising a Multi-Path Decider and Graph-Encoded Navigator. As an LLM-powered agent, the Multi-Path Decider defines a four-dimensional decision space and continuously perceives environmental states, dynamically selecting the optimal action to fully cover all tool invocation scenarios. The Graph-Encoded Navigator constructs a Tool Dependency Heterogeneous Graph (TDHG), where node embeddings explicitly fuse API schema structure with historical invocation behavior. It also integrates a novel heuristic search strategy that guides the Decider toward efficient and highly successful toolchains, even for unseen tool combinations. Experiments show that NaviAgent consistently achieves the highest task success rate (TSR) across all foundation models and task complexities, outperforming the average baselines (ReAct, ToolLLM, {alpha}-UMI) by 13.5%, 16.4%, and 19.0% on Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-32B, and Deepseek-V3, respectively. Its execution steps are typically within one step of the most efficient baseline, ensuring a strong balance between quality and efficiency. Notably, a fine-tuned Qwen2.5-14B model achieves a TSR of 49.5%, surpassing the much larger 32B model (44.9%) under our architecture. Incorporating the Graph-Encoded Navigator further boosts TSR by an average of 2.4 points, with gains up over 9 points on complex tasks for larger models (Deepseek-V3 and GPT-4o), highlighting its essential role in toolchain orchestration.",

However, the limited number and intensity of X-ray projections make reconstruction an ill-posed problem with severe artifacts. NeRF-based methods have achieved great success in this task. However, they suffer from a local-global training mismatch between their two key components: the hash encoder and the neural network. Specifically, in each training step, only a subset of the hash encoder's parameters is used (local sparse), whereas all parameters in the neural network participate (global dense). Consequently, hash features generated in each step are highly misaligned, as they come from different subsets of the hash encoder. These misalignments from different training steps are then fed into the neural network, causing repeated inconsistent global updates in training, which leads to unstable training, slower convergence, and degraded reconstruction quality. Aiming to alleviate the impact of this local-global optimization mismatch, we introduce a Normalized Hash Encoder, which enhances feature consistency and mitigates the mismatch. Additionally, we propose a Mapping Consistency Initialization(MCI) strategy that initializes the neural network before training by leveraging the global mapping property from a well-trained model. The initialized neural network exhibits improved stability during early training, enabling faster convergence and enhanced reconstruction performance.

The intensification of combat forces players to act wisely and engage in tactical maneuvers, even though the generated encounters guarantee high win rates (70%).

We introduce Outlier-Safe Pre-Training (OSP), a practical guideline that proactively prevents outlier formation rather than relying on post-hoc mitigation. OSP combines three key innovations: (1) the Muon optimizer, eliminating privileged bases while maintaining training efficiency; (2) Single-Scale RMSNorm, preventing channel-wise amplification; and (3) a learnable embedding projection, redistributing activation magnitudes originating from embedding matrices. We validate OSP by training a 1.4B-parameter model on 1 trillion tokens, which is the first production-scale LLM trained without such outliers. Under aggressive 4-bit quantization, our OSP model achieves a 35.7 average score across 10 benchmarks (compared to 26.5 for an Adam-trained model), with only a 2% training overhead. Remarkably, OSP models exhibit near-zero excess kurtosis (0.04) compared to extreme values (1818.56) in standard models, fundamentally altering LLM quantization behavior.

Remarkably, OSP models exhibit near-zero excess kurtosis (0.04) compared to extreme values (1818.56) in standard models, fundamentally altering LLM quantization behavior. Our work demonstrates that outliers are not inherent to LLMs but are consequences of training strategies, paving the way for more efficient LLM deployment.

    "description": "arXiv:2506.17338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: The proliferation of multi-agent systems (MAS) in complex, dynamic environments necessitates robust and efficient mechanisms for managing shared knowledge. A critical challenge is ensuring that distributed memories remain synchronized, relevant, and free from the accumulation of outdated or inconsequential data - a process analogous to biological forgetting. This paper introduces the Co-Forgetting Protocol, a novel, comprehensive framework designed to address this challenge by enabling synchronized memory pruning in MAS. The protocol integrates three key components: (1) context-aware semantic voting, where agents utilize a lightweight DistilBERT model to assess the relevance of memory items based on their content and the current operational context; (2) multi-scale temporal decay functions, which assign diminishing importance to memories based on their age and access frequency across different time horizons; and (3) a Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)-based consensus mechanism, ensuring that decisions to retain or discard memory items are agreed upon by a qualified and fault-tolerant majority of agents, even in the presence of up to f Byzantine (malicious or faulty) agents in a system of N greater than or equal to 3f+1 agents. The protocol leverages gRPC for efficient inter-agent communication and Pinecone for scalable vector embedding storage and similarity search, with SQLite managing metadata. Experimental evaluations in a simulated MAS environment with four agents demonstrate the protocol's efficacy, achieving a 52% reduction in memory footprint over 500 epochs, 88% voting accuracy in forgetting decisions against human-annotated benchmarks, a 92% PBFT consensus success rate under simulated Byzantine conditions, and an 82% cache hit rate for memory access.",

Such heuristics falter under parallel unmasking - they ignore pairwise interactions between tokens and cannot account for dependencies when unmasking multiple positions at once, limiting their inference time to traditional auto-regressive (AR) models. We introduce the Dilated-scheduled Unmasking Strategy (DUS), an inference-only, planner-model-free method that requires no additional training. DUS leverages a first-order Markov assumption to partition sequence positions into dilation-based groups of non-adjacent tokens, enabling independent, parallel unmasking steps that respect local context that minimizes the joint entropy of each iteration step. Unlike semi-AR block approaches (e.g., LLADA and Dream) that still invoke the denoiser per block, DUS reduces the number of denoiser calls to O(log B) per generation block - yielding substantial speedup over the O(B) run time of state-of-the-art diffusion models, where B is the block size in the semi-AR inference process. In experiments on math (GSM8K) and code completion (Humaneval, MBPP) benchmarks - domains suited to non-ordinal generation - DUS improves scores over parallel confidence-based planner, without modifying the underlying denoiser.

Alternatively, they can run less powerful models locally on trusted devices. We bridge this gap. Our Socratic Chain-of-Thought Reasoning first sends a generic, non-private user query to a powerful, untrusted LLM, which generates a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt and detailed sub-queries without accessing user data.

Privacy extraction attacks, such as jailbreaking, expose vulnerabilities in LLMs by crafting inputs that force the models to output sensitive information. However, these attacks cannot verify whether the extracted private information is accurate, as no public datasets exist for cross-validation, leaving a critical gap in private information detection during inference. To address this, we propose PrivacyXray, a novel framework detecting privacy breaches by analyzing LLM inner states. Our analysis reveals that LLMs exhibit higher semantic coherence and probabilistic certainty when generating correct private outputs. Based on this, PrivacyXray detects privacy breaches using four metrics: intra-layer and inter-layer semantic similarity, token-level and sentence-level probability distributions. PrivacyXray addresses critical challenges in private information detection by overcoming the lack of open-source private datasets and eliminating reliance on external data for validation. It achieves this through the synthesis of realistic private data and a detection mechanism based on the inner states of LLMs. Experiments show that PrivacyXray achieves consistent performance, with an average accuracy of 92.69% across five LLMs. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, PrivacyXray achieves significant improvements, with an average accuracy increase of 20.06%, highlighting its stability and practical utility in real-world applications.",

This design enables LLMs not only to access relevant information but also to apply it within structured, goal-oriented reasoning processes. Experiments across mathematical, legal, and medical domains, conducted on multiple models, demonstrate that RAG+ consistently outperforms standard RAG variants, achieving average improvements of 3-5%, and peak gains up to 7.5% in complex scenarios.

To address these challenges, we propose RareSpot, a robust detection framework integrating multi-scale consistency learning and context-aware augmentation. Our multi-scale consistency approach leverages structured alignment across feature pyramids, enhancing fine-grained object representation and mitigating scale-related feature loss.

Evaluated on an expert-annotated prairie dog drone imagery benchmark, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving detection accuracy by over 35% compared to baseline methods.

This stage guides the model through multi-step reasoning and holistic decision-making via a flexibly defined reward function, aiming to concurrently optimize recommendation accuracy, diversity, and other bespoke business objectives. Empirical evaluations on a real-world user behavior dataset from a large-scale social media platform demonstrate that RecLLM-R1 significantly surpasses existing baseline methods across a spectrum of evaluation metrics, including accuracy, diversity, and novelty.

Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more effective than having access to 2x web data.

Existing approaches can be roughly categorized into two research lines: the point-wise based models and the segment-wise based models. Although segment-wise approaches have obtained promising results in many scenarios, they often suffer from computational inefficiency and heavily rely on a prescribed prior to fit the target elongated shapes. We propose a novel framework that casts segment-wise tracking as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling a reinforcement learning approach. Our method leverages Q-Learning to dynamically explore a graph of segments, computing edge weights on-demand and adaptively expanding the search space. This strategy avoids the high cost of a pre-computed graph and proves robust to incomplete initial information. Experimental reuslts on typical tubular structure datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art point-wise and segment-wise approaches.

Existing approaches can be roughly categorized into two research lines: the point-wise based models and the segment-wise based models. Although segment-wise approaches have obtained promising results in many scenarios, they often suffer from computational inefficiency and heavily rely on a prescribed prior to fit the target elongated shapes. We propose a novel framework that casts segment-wise tracking as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling a reinforcement learning approach. Our method leverages Q-Learning to dynamically explore a graph of segments, computing edge weights on-demand and adaptively expanding the search space. This strategy avoids the high cost of a pre-computed graph and proves robust to incomplete initial information. Experimental reuslts on typical tubular structure datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art point-wise and segment-wise approaches. The proposed method effectively handles complex topologies and maintains global path coherence without depending on extensive prior structural knowledge.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.19531v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Artifacts in kilo-Voltage CT (kVCT) imaging degrade image quality, impacting clinical decisions. We propose a deep learning framework for metal artifact reduction (MAR) and domain transformation from kVCT to Mega-Voltage CT (MVCT). The proposed framework, ReMAR-DS, utilizes an encoder-decoder architecture with enhanced feature recalibration, effectively reducing artifacts while preserving anatomical structures. This ensures that only relevant information is utilized in the reconstruction process. By infusing recalibrated features from the encoder block, the model focuses on relevant spatial regions (e.g., areas with artifacts) and highlights key features across channels (e.g., anatomical structures), leading to improved reconstruction of artifact-corrupted regions. Unlike traditional MAR methods, our approach bridges the gap between high-resolution kVCT and artifact-resistant MVCT, enhancing radiotherapy planning. It produces high-quality MVCT-like reconstructions, validated through qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Clinically, this enables oncologists to rely on kVCT alone, reducing repeated high-dose MVCT scans and lowering radiation exposure for cancer patients.",

For data parallelism, we compare synchronous and asynchronous modes, combining gradient compression and sparsification techniques with an efficient aggregation communication framework to significantly improve bandwidth utilization. Experiments conducted on a real-world recommendation dataset in a simulated service environment demonstrate that our proposed hybrid parallelism scheme increases training throughput by over 30% and improves resource utilization by approximately 20% compared to traditional single-mode parallelism, while maintaining strong scalability and robustness.

To address this limitation, we propose a conditional diffusion model for adversary behavior modeling, leveraging its strong distribution-fitting capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of diffusion models in the green security domain. Integrating diffusion models into game-theoretic optimization, however, presents new challenges, including a constrained mixed strategy space and the need to sample from an unnormalized distribution to estimate utilities. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a mixed strategy of mixed strategies and employ a twisted Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampler for accurate sampling.

This allows for a more robust estimation of the so-called $alpha$-stable spatial measure, which represents the most plausible direction of arrival (DOA) of a target signal. As an $alpha$-stable model for the non-Gaussian case ($alpha$ $in$ (0, 2)) theoretically defines a unique spatial measure, we choose to leverage it to account for residual reconstruction error of the Neural Steerer in the downstream tasks. The objective scores indicate that our proposed technique outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the case of multiple sound sources.",

Using the NEC-DAC (Neurally Encoded Culture - Distributed Autonomous Communicators) system, where each agent is equipped with its own neural network for decision-making, we demonstrate how these agents develop a shared behavioral system -- akin to a culture -- through learning and signalling. Our research focuses on the self-organization of culture within these tribes of agents and how varying communication strategies impact their fitness and cooperation. By analyzing different social structures, such as authority hierarchies, we show that the culture of cooperation significantly influences the tribe's performance. Furthermore, we explore how signals not only facilitate the emergence of culture but also enable its transmission across generations of agents.

    "title": "Skywork-SWE: Unveiling Data Scaling Laws for Software Engineering in LLMs",
    "description": "arXiv:2506.19290v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Software engineering (SWE) has recently emerged as a crucial testbed for next-generation LLM agents, demanding inherent capabilities in two critical dimensions: sustained iterative problem-solving (e.g., >50 interaction rounds) and long-context dependency resolution (e.g., >32k tokens). However, the data curation process in SWE remains notoriously time-consuming, as it heavily relies on manual annotation for code file filtering and the setup of dedicated runtime environments to execute and validate unit tests. Consequently, most existing datasets are limited to only a few thousand GitHub-sourced instances. To this end, we propose an incremental, automated data-curation pipeline that systematically scales both the volume and diversity of SWE datasets. Our dataset comprises 10,169 real-world Python task instances from 2,531 distinct GitHub repositories, each accompanied by a task specified in natural language and a dedicated runtime-environment image for automated unit-test validation. We have carefully curated over 8,000 successfully runtime-validated training trajectories from our proposed SWE dataset. When fine-tuning the Skywork-SWE model on these trajectories, we uncover a striking data scaling phenomenon: the trained model's performance for software engineering capabilities in LLMs continues to improve as the data size increases, showing no signs of saturation. Notably, our Skywork-SWE model achieves 38.0% pass@1 accuracy on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark without using verifiers or multiple rollouts, establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) among the Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-based LLMs built on the OpenHands agent framework. Furthermore, with the incorporation of test-time scaling techniques, the performance further improves to 47.0% accuracy, surpassing the previous SOTA results for sub-32B parameter models. We release the Skywork-SWE-32B model checkpoint to accelerate future research.",

Utilizing Pygame, a simulation was developed to model a network of interconnected intersections with randomly generated vehicle flows to reflect realistic traffic variability. A decentralized MARL controller was implemented, in which each traffic signal operates as an autonomous agent, making decisions based on local observations and information from neighboring agents. Performance was evaluated against a baseline fixed-time controller using metrics such as average vehicle wait time and overall throughput. The MARL approach demonstrated statistically significant improvements, including reduced average waiting times and improved throughput.

We present the GITes (Gita Integrated Therapy for Emotional Support) dataset, which enhances the existing ExTES mental health dataset by including 10,729 spiritually guided responses generated by GPT-4o and evaluated by domain experts. We benchmark GITes against 12 state-of-the-art LLMs, including both mental health specific and general purpose models. To evaluate spiritual relevance in generated responses beyond what conventional n-gram based metrics capture, we propose a novel Spiritual Insight metric and automate assessment via an LLM as jury framework using chain-of-thought prompting. Integrating spiritual guidance into AI driven support enhances both NLP and spiritual metrics for the best performing LLM Phi3-Mini 3.2B Instruct, achieving improvements of 122.71% in ROUGE, 126.53% in METEOR, 8.15% in BERT score, 15.92% in Spiritual Insight, 18.61% in Sufficiency and 13.22% in Relevance compared to its zero-shot counterpart. While these results reflect substantial improvements across automated empathy and spirituality metrics, further validation in real world patient populations remains a necessary step. Our findings indicate a strong potential for AI systems enriched with spiritual guidance to enhance user satisfaction and perceived support outcomes.

Existing evaluation methods typically assign single scores to entire responses, struggling to capture subtle persona misalignment, particularly in long-form text generation. To address this limitation, we propose an atomic-level evaluation framework that quantifies persona fidelity at a finer granularity. Our three key metrics measure the degree of persona alignment and consistency within and across generations. Our approach enables a more precise and realistic assessment of persona fidelity by identifying subtle deviations that real users would encounter. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that our framework effectively detects persona inconsistencies that prior methods overlook. By analyzing persona fidelity across diverse tasks and personality types, we reveal how task structure and persona desirability influence model adaptability, highlighting challenges in maintaining consistent persona expression.",

This survey presents a comprehensive assessment of the HPC landscape across U.S. universities, benchmarking their capabilities against Department of Energy (DOE) leadership-class systems and industrial AI infrastructures. We examine over 50 premier research institutions, analyzing compute capacity, architectural design, governance models, and energy efficiency. Our findings reveal that university clusters, though vital for academic research, exhibit significantly lower growth trajectories (CAGR $approx$ 18%) than their national ($approx$ 43%) and industrial ($approx$ 78%) counterparts. The increasing skew toward GPU-dense AI workloads has widened the capability gap, highlighting the need for federated computing, idle-GPU harvesting, and cost-sharing models. We also identify emerging paradigms, such as decentralized reinforcement learning, as promising opportunities for democratizing AI training within campus environments. Ultimately, this work provides actionable insights for academic leaders, funding agencies, and technology partners to ensure more equitable and sustainable HPC access in support of national research priorities.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.18951v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Resolution of complex SQL issues persists as a significant bottleneck in real-world database applications. Current Large Language Models (LLMs), while adept at text-to-SQL translation, have not been rigorously evaluated on the more challenging task of debugging SQL issues. To address this gap, we introduce BIRD-CRITIC, a new SQL issue debugging benchmark comprising 530 PostgreSQL tasks (BIRD-CRITIC-PG) and 570 multi-dialect tasks (BIRD-CRITIC-Multi), distilled from authentic user issues and replayed within new environments to facilitate rigorous evaluation. Baseline evaluations underscore the task's complexity, with the leading reasoning model O3-Mini achieving only 38.87% success rate on BIRD-CRITIC-PG and 33.33% on BIRD-CRITIC-Multi. Meanwhile, advancing open-source models for database tasks is crucial for empowering local development while safeguarding data privacy. Therefore, we present Six-Gym (Sql-fIX-Gym), a training environment for elevating open-source model capabilities for SQL issue debugging. This environment leverages SQL-Rewind strategy, which automatically generates executable issue-solution datasets by reverse-engineering issues from verified SQLs. However, popular trajectory-based fine-tuning methods do not explore substantial supervisory signals. We further propose f-Plan Boosting, which extracts high-level debugging plans from SQL solutions, enabling teacher LLMs to produce 73.7% more successful trajectories for training. We integrate these components into an open-source agent, Bird-Fixer. Based on Qwen-2.5-Coder-14B, Bird-Fixer achieves 38.11% success rate on BIRD-CRITIC-PG and 29.65% on BIRD-CRITIC-Multi, surpassing leading proprietary models such as Claude-3.7-Sonnet and GPT-4.1, marking a significant step toward democratizing sophisticated SQL-debugging capabilities.

In contrast, existing AI algorithms struggle to maintain accuracy under similar conditions. Here, we present SyncMapV2, the first to solve unsupervised segmentation with state-of-the-art robustness. SyncMapV2 exhibits a minimal drop in mIoU, only 0.01%, under digital corruption, compared to a 23.8% drop observed in SOTA methods. This superior performance extends across various types of corruption: noise (7.3% vs. 37.7%), weather (7.5% vs. 33.8%), and blur (7.0% vs. 29.5%). Notably, SyncMapV2 accomplishes this without any robust training, supervision, or loss functions. It is based on a learning paradigm that uses self-organizing dynamical equations combined with concepts from random networks. Moreover, unlike conventional methods that require re-initialization for each new input, SyncMapV2 adapts online, mimicking the continuous adaptability of human vision. Thus, we go beyond the accurate and robust results, and present the first algorithm that can do all the above online, adapting to input rather than re-initializing. In adaptability tests, SyncMapV2 demonstrates near-zero performance degradation, which motivates and fosters a new generation of robust and adaptive intelligence in the near future.",

We argue that analyzing reasoning traces at the sentence level is a promising approach to understanding reasoning processes. We present three complementary attribution methods: (1) a black-box method measuring each sentence's counterfactual importance by comparing final answers across 100 rollouts conditioned on the model generating that sentence or one with a different meaning; (2) a white-box method of aggregating attention patterns between pairs of sentences, which identified ``broadcasting'' sentences that receive disproportionate attention from all future sentences via ``receiver'' attention heads; (3) a causal attribution method measuring logical connections between sentences by suppressing attention toward one sentence and measuring the effect on each future sentence's tokens. Each method provides evidence for the existence of thought anchors, reasoning steps that have outsized importance and that disproportionately influence the subsequent reasoning process.

    "title": "Toward Decision-Oriented Prognostics: An Integrated Estimate-Optimize Framework for Predictive Maintenance",
    "description": "arXiv:2506.19698v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Recent research increasingly integrates machine learning (ML) into predictive maintenance (PdM) to reduce operational and maintenance costs in data-rich operational settings. However, uncertainty due to model misspecification continues to limit widespread industrial adoption. This paper proposes a PdM framework in which sensor-driven prognostics inform decision-making under economic trade-offs within a finite decision space. We investigate two key questions: (1) Does higher predictive accuracy necessarily lead to better maintenance decisions? (2) If not, how can the impact of prediction errors on downstream maintenance decisions be mitigated? We first demonstrate that in the traditional estimate-then-optimize (ETO) framework, errors in probabilistic prediction can result in inconsistent and suboptimal maintenance decisions. To address this, we propose an integrated estimate-optimize (IEO) framework that jointly tunes predictive models while directly optimizing for maintenance outcomes. We establish theoretical finite-sample guarantees on decision consistency under standard assumptions.

Empirical evaluations on a turbofan maintenance case study show that the IEO framework reduces average maintenance regret up to 22% compared to ETO. This study provides a principled approach to managing prediction errors in data-driven PdM. By aligning prognostic model training with maintenance objectives, the IEO framework improves robustness under model misspecification and improves decision quality.

    "summary": "arXiv:2506.19698v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Recent research increasingly integrates machine learning (ML) into predictive maintenance (PdM) to reduce operational and maintenance costs in data-rich operational settings. However, uncertainty due to model misspecification continues to limit widespread industrial adoption. This paper proposes a PdM framework in which sensor-driven prognostics inform decision-making under economic trade-offs within a finite decision space. We investigate two key questions: (1) Does higher predictive accuracy necessarily lead to better maintenance decisions? (2) If not, how can the impact of prediction errors on downstream maintenance decisions be mitigated? We first demonstrate that in the traditional estimate-then-optimize (ETO) framework, errors in probabilistic prediction can result in inconsistent and suboptimal maintenance decisions. To address this, we propose an integrated estimate-optimize (IEO) framework that jointly tunes predictive models while directly optimizing for maintenance outcomes. We establish theoretical finite-sample guarantees on decision consistency under standard assumptions. Specifically, we develop a stochastic perturbation gradient descent algorithm suitable for small run-to-failure datasets.

    "description": "arXiv:2506.19578v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Large-scale scientific collaborations like ATLAS, Belle II, CMS, DUNE, and others involve hundreds of research institutes and thousands of researchers spread across the globe. These experiments generate petabytes of data, with volumes soon expected to reach exabytes. Consequently, there is a growing need for computation, including structured data processing from raw data to consumer-ready derived data, extensive Monte Carlo simulation campaigns, and a wide range of end-user analysis. To manage these computational and storage demands, centralized workflow and data management systems are implemented. However, decisions regarding data placement and payload allocation are often made disjointly and via heuristic means. A significant obstacle in adopting more effective heuristic or AI-driven solutions is the absence of a quick and reliable introspective dynamic model to evaluate and refine alternative approaches. In this study, we aim to develop such an interactive system using real-world data. By examining job execution records from the PanDA workflow management system, we have pinpointed key performance indicators such as queuing time, error rate, and the extent of remote data access. The dataset includes five months of activity. Additionally, we are creating a generative AI model to simulate time series of payloads, which incorporate visible features like category, event count, and submitting group, as well as hidden features like the total computational load-derived from existing PanDA records and computing site capabilities.

    "description": "arXiv:2501.16490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Smart grids are crucial for meeting rising energy demands driven by global population growth and urbanization. By integrating renewable energy sources, they enhance efficiency, reliability, and sustainability. However, ensuring their availability and security requires advanced operational control and safety measures. Although artificial intelligence and machine learning can help assess grid stability, challenges such as data scarcity and cybersecurity threats, particularly adversarial attacks, remain. Data scarcity is a major issue, as obtaining real-world instances of grid instability requires significant expertise, resources, and time. Yet, these instances are critical for testing new research advancements and security mitigations. This paper introduces a novel framework for detecting instability in smart grids using only stable data. It employs a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) where the generator is designed not to produce near-realistic data but instead to generate Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) samples with respect to the stable class. These OOD samples represent unstable behavior, anomalies, or disturbances that deviate from the stable data distribution. By training exclusively on stable data and exposing the discriminator to OOD samples, our framework learns a robust decision boundary to distinguish stable conditions from any unstable behavior, without requiring unstable data during training. Furthermore, we incorporate an adversarial training layer to enhance resilience against attacks. Evaluated on a real-world dataset, our solution achieves up to 98.1% accuracy in predicting grid stability and 98.9% in detecting adversarial attacks. Implemented on a single-board computer, it enables real-time decision-making with an average response time of under 7ms.",

These failure modes have largely been documented anecdotally, leaving open the question of whether they reflect idiosyncratic anomalies or more structural limitations of these models. To address this, we introduce a systematic approach for identifying and characterizing 'conceptual blindspots' -- concepts present in the training data but absent or misrepresented in a model's generations. Our method leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to extract interpretable concept embeddings, enabling a quantitative comparison of concept prevalence between real and generated images. We train an archetypal SAE (RA-SAE) on DINOv2 features with 32,000 concepts -- the largest such SAE to date -- enabling fine-grained analysis of conceptual disparities. Applied to four popular generative models (Stable Diffusion 1.5/2.1, PixArt, and Kandinsky), our approach reveals specific suppressed blindspots (e.g., bird feeders, DVD discs, and whitespaces on documents) and exaggerated blindspots (e.g., wood background texture and palm trees). At the individual datapoint level, we further isolate memorization artifacts -- instances where models reproduce highly specific visual templates seen during training.

This ambiguity presents theoretical challenges, as interpersonal trust models may inappropriately ascribe human intentionality and morality to AI, while technology trust models were developed for non-social technologies, leaving their applicability to anthropomorphic systems unclear. To address this gap, we investigate how human-like and system-like trusting beliefs comparatively influence students' perceived enjoyment, trusting intention, behavioral intention to use, and perceived usefulness of an AI chatbot - factors associated with students' engagement and learning outcomes. Through partial least squares structural equation modeling, we found that human-like and system-like trust significantly influenced student perceptions, with varied effects. Human-like trust more strongly predicted trusting intention, while system-like trust better predicted behavioral intention and perceived usefulness. Both had similar effects on perceived enjoyment. Given the partial explanatory power of each type of trust, we propose that students develop a distinct form of trust with AI chatbots (human-AI trust) that differs from human-human and human-technology models of trust.

    "description": "arXiv:2502.18185v4 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning, especially when dealing with complex anatomical structures such as vessels. However, accurately segmenting vessels remains challenging due to their small size, intricate edge structures, and susceptibility to artifacts and imaging noise. In this work, we propose VesselSAM, an enhanced version of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), specifically tailored for aortic vessel segmentation. VesselSAM incorporates AtrousLoRA, a novel module integrating Atrous Attention and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to enhance segmentation performance. Atrous Attention enables the model to capture multi-scale contextual information, preserving both fine-grained local details and broader global context. Additionally, LoRA facilitates efficient fine-tuning of the frozen SAM image encoder, reducing the number of trainable parameters and thereby enhancing computational efficiency. We evaluate VesselSAM using two challenging datasets: the Aortic Vessel Tree (AVT) dataset and the Type-B Aortic Dissection (TBAD) dataset. VesselSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining DSC scores of 93.50%, 93.25%, 93.02%, and 93.26% across multi-center datasets. Our results demonstrate that VesselSAM delivers high segmentation accuracy while significantly reducing computational overhead compared to existing large-scale models. This development paves the way for enhanced AI-based aortic vessel segmentation in clinical environments. The code and models will be released at https://github.com/Adnan-CAS/AtrousLora.",

    "description": "arXiv:2506.19225v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) models have made significant progress in video understanding over the past few years. However, processing long video inputs remains a major challenge due to high memory and computational costs. This makes it difficult for current models to achieve both strong performance and high efficiency in long video understanding. To address this challenge, we propose Video-XL-2, a novel MLLM that delivers superior cost-effectiveness for long-video understanding based on task-aware KV sparsification. The proposed framework operates with two key steps: chunk-based pre-filling and bi-level key-value decoding. Chunk-based pre-filling divides the visual token sequence into chunks, applying full attention within each chunk and sparse attention across chunks. This significantly reduces computational and memory overhead. During decoding, bi-level key-value decoding selectively reloads either dense or sparse key-values for each chunk based on its relevance to the task. This approach further improves memory efficiency and enhances the model's ability to capture fine-grained information. Video-XL-2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on various long video understanding benchmarks, outperforming existing open-source lightweight models. It also demonstrates exceptional efficiency, capable of processing over 10,000 frames on a single NVIDIA A100 (80GB) GPU and thousands of frames in just a few seconds.",

This paper addresses this practical limitation by demonstrating how e-conformal prediction, in conjunction with Hoeffding's inequality, can enable the repeated use of a single calibration set with a high probability of preserving the desired coverage. Through a case study on the CIFAR-10 dataset, we train a deep neural network and utilise a calibration set to estimate a Hoeffding correction. This correction allows us to apply a modified Markov's inequality, leading to the construction of prediction sets with quantifiable confidence.
