title: "Towards Generalizable Generic Harmful Speech Datasets for Implicit Hate Speech Detection"
description: "arXiv:2506.16476v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Implicit hate speech has recently emerged as a critical challenge for social media platforms. While much of the research has traditionally focused on harmful speech in general, the need for generalizable techniques to detect veiled and subtle forms of hate has become increasingly pressing. Based on lexicon analysis, we hypothesize that implicit hate speech is already present in publicly available harmful speech datasets but may not have been explicitly recognized or labeled by annotators. Additionally, crowdsourced datasets are prone to mislabeling due to the complexity of the task and often influenced by annotators' subjective interpretations. In this paper, we propose an approach to address the detection of implicit hate speech and enhance generalizability across diverse datasets by leveraging existing harmful speech datasets. Our method comprises three key components: influential sample identification, reannotation, and augmentation using Llama-3 70B and GPT-4o. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving implicit hate detection, achieving a +12.9-point F1 score improvement compared to the baseline."
