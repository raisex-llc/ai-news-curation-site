title: "Dissecting the SWE-Bench Leaderboards: Profiling Submitters and Architectures of LLM- and Agent-Based Repair Systems"
description: "arXiv:2506.17208v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The rapid progress in Automated Program Repair (APR) has been driven by advances in AI, particularly large language models (LLMs) and agent-based systems. SWE-Bench is a recent benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based repair systems using real issues and pull requests mined from 12 popular open-source Python repositories. Its public leaderboards, SWE-Bench Lite and SWE-Bench Verified, have become central platforms for tracking progress and comparing solutions. However, because the submission process does not require detailed documentation, the architectural design and origin of many solutions remain unclear. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of all submissions to the SWE-Bench Lite (68 entries) and Verified (79 entries) leaderboards, analyzing 67 unique approaches across dimensions such as submitter type, product availability, LLM usage, and system architecture. Our findings reveal the dominance of proprietary LLMs (especially Claude 3.5/3.7), the presence of both agentic and non-agentic designs, and a contributor base spanning from individual developers to large tech companies."
