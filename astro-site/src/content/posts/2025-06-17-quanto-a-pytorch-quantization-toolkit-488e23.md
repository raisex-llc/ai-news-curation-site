Quanto: a PyTorch quantization backend for Optimum
Quantization is a technique to reduce the computational and memory costs of evaluating Deep Learning Models by representing their weights and activations with low-precision data types like 8-bit integer (int8) instead of the usual 32-bit floating point (float32).
Reducing the number of bits means the resulting model requires less memory storage, which is crucial for deploying Large Language Models on consumer devices.
It also enables specific optimizations for lower bitwidth datatypes, such as int8
or float8
matrix multiplications on CUDA devices.
Many open-source libraries are available to quantize pytorch Deep Learning Models, each providing very powerful features, yet often restricted to specific model configurations and devices.
Also, although they are based on the same design principles, they are unfortunately often incompatible with one another.
Today, we are excited to introduce quanto, a PyTorch quantization backend for Optimum.
It has been designed with versatility and simplicity in mind:
- all features are available in eager mode (works with non-traceable models),
- quantized models can be placed on any device (including CUDA and MPS),
- automatically inserts quantization and dequantization stubs,
- automatically inserts quantized functional operations,
- automatically inserts quantized modules (see below the list of supported modules),
- provides a seamless workflow from a float model to a dynamic to a static quantized model,
- serialization compatible with PyTorch
weight_only
and 🤗 Safetensors, - accelerated matrix multiplications on CUDA devices (int8-int8, fp16-int4, bf16-int8, bf16-int4),
- supports int2, int4, int8 and float8 weights,
- supports int8 and float8 activations.
Recent quantization methods appear to be focused on quantizing Large Language Models (LLMs), whereas quanto intends to provide extremely simple quantization primitives for simple quantization schemes (linear quantization, per-group quantization) that are adaptable across any modality.
Quantization workflow
Quanto is available as a pip package.
pip install optimum-quanto
A typical quantization workflow consists of the following steps:
1. Quantize
The first step converts a standard float model into a dynamically quantized model.
from optimum.quanto import quantize, qint8
quantize(model, weights=qint8, activations=qint8)
At this stage, only the inference of the model is modified to dynamically quantize the weights.
2. Calibrate (optional if activations are not quantized)
Quanto supports a calibration mode that allows the recording of the activation ranges while passing representative samples through the quantized model.
from optimum.quanto import Calibration
with Calibration(momentum=0.9):
model(samples)
This automatically activates the quantization of the activations in the quantized modules.
3. Tune, aka Quantization-Aware-Training (optional)
If the performance of the model degrades too much, one can tune it for a few epochs to recover the float model performance.
import torch
model.train()
for batch_idx, (data, target) in enumerate(train_loader):
data, target = data.to(device), target.to(device)
optimizer.zero_grad()
output = model(data).dequantize()
loss = torch.nn.functional.nll_loss(output, target)
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()
4. Freeze integer weights
When freezing a model, its float weights are replaced by quantized weights.
from optimum.quanto import freeze
freeze(model)
5. Serialize quantized model
Quantized models weights can be serialized to a state_dict
, and saved to a file.
Both pickle
and safetensors
(recommended) are supported.
from safetensors.torch import save_file
save_file(model.state_dict(), 'model.safetensors')
In order to reload these weights, you also need to store the quantized models quantization map.
import json
from optimum.quanto import quantization_map
with open('quantization_map.json', w) as f:
json.dump(quantization_map(model))
5. Reload a quantized model
A serialized quantized model can be reloaded from a state_dict
and a quantization_map
using the requantize
helper.
Note that you need to first instantiate an empty model.
import json
from safetensors.torch import load_file
state_dict = load_file('model.safetensors')
with open('quantization_map.json', r) as f:
quantization_map = json.load(f)
# Create an empty model from your modeling code and requantize it
with torch.device('meta'):
new_model = ...
requantize(new_model, state_dict, quantization_map, device=torch.device('cuda'))
Please refer to the examples for instantiations of the quantization workflow. You can also check this notebook where we show you how to quantize a BLOOM model with quanto!
Performance
Below are two graphs evaluating the accuracy of different quantized configurations for meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B.
Note: the first bar in each group always corresponds to the non-quantized model.
These results are obtained without applying any Post-Training-Optimization algorithm like hqq or AWQ.
The graph below gives the latency per-token measured on an NVIDIA A10 GPU.
Stay tuned for updated results as we are constantly improving quanto with optimizers and optimized kernels.
Please refer to the quanto benchmarks for detailed results for different model architectures and configurations.
Integration in transformers
Quanto is seamlessly integrated in the Hugging Face transformers library. You can quantize any model by passing a QuantoConfig
to from_pretrained
!
Currently, you need to use the latest version of accelerate to make sure the integration is fully compatible.
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, QuantoConfig
model_id = "facebook/opt-125m"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
quantization_config = QuantoConfig(weights="int8")
quantized_model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
model_id,
quantization_config= quantization_config
)
You can quantize the weights and/or activations in int8, float8, int4, or int2 by simply passing the correct argument in QuantoConfig
. The activations can be either in int8 or float8. For float8, you need to have hardware that is compatible with float8 precision, otherwise quanto will silently upcast the weights and activations to torch.float32 or torch.float16 (depending on the original data type of the model) when we perform the matmul (only when the weight is quantized). If you try to use float8
using MPS devices, torch
will currently raise an error.
Quanto is device agnostic, meaning you can quantize and run your model regardless if you are on CPU/GPU/ MPS (Apple Silicon).
Quanto is also torch.compile friendly. You can quantize a model with quanto and call torch.compile
to the model to compile it for faster generation. This feature might not work out of the box if dynamic quantization is involved (i.e., Quantization Aware Training or quantized activations enabled). Make sure to keep activations=None
when creating your QuantoConfig
in case you use the transformers integration.
It is also possible to quantize any model, regardless of the modality using quanto! We demonstrate how to quantize openai/whisper-large-v3
model in int8 using quanto.
from transformers import AutoModelForSpeechSeq2Seq
model_id = "openai/whisper-large-v3"
quanto_config = QuantoConfig(weights="int8")
model = AutoModelForSpeechSeq2Seq.from_pretrained(
model_id,
torch_dtype=torch.float16,
device_map="cuda",
quantization_config=quanto_config
)
Check out this notebook for a complete tutorial on how to properly use quanto with the transformers integration!
