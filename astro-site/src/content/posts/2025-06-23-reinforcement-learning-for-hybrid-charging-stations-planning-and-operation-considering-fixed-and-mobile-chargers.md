title: "Reinforcement learning for hybrid charging stations planning and operation considering fixed and mobile chargers"
description: "arXiv:2506.16764v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The success of vehicle electrification, which brings significant societal and environmental benefits, is contingent upon the availability of efficient and adaptable charging infrastructure. Traditional fixed-location charging stations often face issues like underutilization or congestion due to the dynamic nature of charging demand. Mobile chargers have emerged as a flexible solution, capable of relocating to align with these demand fluctuations. This paper addresses the optimal planning and operation of hybrid charging infrastructures, integrating both fixed and mobile chargers within urban road networks. We introduce the Hybrid Charging Station Planning and Operation (HCSPO) problem, which simultaneously optimizes the location and configuration of fixed charging stations and schedules mobile chargers for dynamic operations. Our approach incorporates a charging demand prediction model grounded in Model Predictive Control (MPC) to enhance decision-making. To solve the HCSPO problem, we propose a deep reinforcement learning method, augmented with heuristic scheduling techniques, to effectively bridge the planning of fixed chargers with the real-time operation of mobile chargers. Extensive case studies using real-world urban scenarios demonstrate that our method significantly improves the availability of charging infrastructure and reduces user inconvenience compared to existing solutions and baselines."
