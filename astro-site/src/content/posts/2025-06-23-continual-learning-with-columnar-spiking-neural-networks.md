title: "Continual Learning with Columnar Spiking Neural Networks"
description: "arXiv:2506.17169v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: This study investigates columnar-organized spiking neural networks (SNNs) for continual learning and catastrophic forgetting. Using CoLaNET (Columnar Layered Network), we show that microcolumns adapt most efficiently to new tasks when they lack shared structure with prior learning. We demonstrate how CoLaNET hyperparameters govern the trade-off between retaining old knowledge (stability) and acquiring new information (plasticity). Our optimal configuration learns ten sequential MNIST tasks effectively, maintaining 92% accuracy on each. It shows low forgetting, with only 4% performance degradation on the first task after training on nine subsequent tasks."
