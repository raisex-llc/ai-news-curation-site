Generate videos in Gemini and Whisk with Veo 2
Starting today, Gemini Advanced users can generate and share videos using our state-of-the-art video model, Veo 2. In Gemini, you can now translate text-based prompts into dynamic videos. Google Labs is also making Veo 2 available through Whisk, a generative AI experiment that allows you to create new images using both text and image prompts, and now animate them into videos.
How to create videos with Gemini
Veo 2 represents a leap forward in video generation, designed to produce high-resolution, detailed videos with cinematic realism. By better understanding real-world physics and human motion, it delivers fluid character movement, lifelike scenes and finer visual details across diverse subjects and styles.
To generate videos, select Veo 2 from the model dropdown 1 in Gemini. This feature creates an eight-second video clip at 720p resolution, delivered as an MP4 file in a 16:9 landscape format. There is a monthly limit on how many videos you can create, but we will notify you as you approach it.
Creating videos with Gemini is simple: just describe the scene you want to create — whether it's a short story, a visual concept, or a specific scene — and Gemini will bring your ideas to life. The more detailed your description, the more control you have over the final video. This opens up a world of fun creative possibilities, letting your imagination go wild to picture unreal combinations, explore varied visual styles from realism to fantasy, or quickly narrate short visual ideas.
One of the best parts of creating is sharing with others. Sharing your video on mobile is easy: simply tap the share button to quickly upload engaging short videos to platforms like TikTok and YouTube Shorts.
Prompt: A wide, slow-panning shot of an enormous glacial cavern, bathed in eerie twilight. Pale cyan light filters from above, illuminating frozen candy figures within the ice walls. Two figures in white exosuits, their helmet lights casting beams, trudge through the center. Capture the cavern's scale and stillness.
Prompt: An animated shot of a tiny mouse with oversized glasses, reading a book by the light of a glowing mushroom in a cozy forest den.
Prompt: Aerial shot of a grassy cliff onto a sandy beach where waves crash against the shore, a prominent sea stack rises from the ocean near the beach, bathed in the warm, golden light of either sunrise or sunset, capturing the serene beauty of the Pacific coastline.
Prompt: Time-lapse of a voxel-style ice cream melting under a clear blue sky. The pink, grey, and white scoops slowly lose their shape, dripping down the yellow, blocky cone held by a large, voxel hand with a blue sleeve. Focus on the melting process, highlighting the changing texture and form of the voxel elements as the ice cream deforms and drips, creating a colorful, pixelated melt against the vibrant blue backdrop.
Video generation is now rolling out to Gemini Advanced users globally on web and mobile, starting today and continuing over the next few weeks. This feature is available to Google One AI Premium subscribers in all languages Gemini supports. Try it out today at gemini.google.com
How Whisk Animate brings your images to life
Introduced in December, Whisk is a Google Labs experiment that helps you quickly explore and visualize new ideas using both text and image prompts. Today, you can animate your creations with Whisk Animate.
Whisk Animate lets you turn your images into vivid eight-second videos using Veo 2. It’s available for Google One AI Premium subscribers in more than 60 countries starting today. Subscribers can try it at labs.google/whisk.
How we approach safety
We’ve taken important steps to make video generation a safe experience. This includes extensive red teaming and evaluation aimed at preventing the generation of content that violates our policies. Additionally, all videos generated with Veo 2 are marked with SynthID, a digital watermark embedded in each frame, which indicates the videos are AI-generated.
Gemini's outputs are primarily determined by user prompts and like any generative AI tool, there may be instances where it generates content that some individuals find objectionable. We’ll continue to listen to your feedback through the thumbs up/down buttons and make ongoing improvements. For more details, you can read about our approach on our website.
We hope you enjoy making videos in the Gemini app and Whisk as Google One AI Premium subscribers.
