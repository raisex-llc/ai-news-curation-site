title: "PQCAD-DM: Progressive Quantization and Calibration-Assisted Distillation for Extremely Efficient Diffusion Model"
description: "arXiv:2506.16776v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Diffusion models excel in image generation but are computational and resource-intensive due to their reliance on iterative Markov chain processes, leading to error accumulation and limiting the effectiveness of naive compression techniques. In this paper, we propose PQCAD-DM, a novel hybrid compression framework combining Progressive Quantization (PQ) and Calibration-Assisted Distillation (CAD) to address these challenges. PQ employs a two-stage quantization with adaptive bit-width transitions guided by a momentum-based mechanism, reducing excessive weight perturbations in low-precision. CAD leverages full-precision calibration datasets during distillation, enabling the student to match full-precision performance even with a quantized teacher. As a result, PQCAD-DM achieves a balance between computational efficiency and generative quality, halving inference time while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments validate PQCAD-DM's superior generative capabilities and efficiency across diverse datasets, outperforming fixed-bit quantization methods."
