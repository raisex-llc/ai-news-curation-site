title: "Artificial Intelligence for Atmospheric Sciences: A Research Roadmap"
description: "arXiv:2506.16281v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Atmospheric sciences are crucial for understanding environmental phenomena ranging from air quality to extreme weather events, and climate change. Recent breakthroughs in sensing, communication, computing, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have significantly advanced atmospheric sciences, enabling the generation of vast amounts of data through long-term Earth observations and providing powerful tools for analyzing atmospheric phenomena and predicting natural disasters. This paper contributes a critical interdisciplinary overview that bridges the fields of atmospheric science and computer science, highlighting the transformative potential of AI in atmospheric research. We identify key challenges associated with integrating AI into atmospheric research, including issues related to big data and infrastructure, and provide a detailed research roadmap that addresses both current and emerging challenges."
