title: "History-Augmented Vision-Language Models for Frontier-Based Zero-Shot Object Navigation"
description: "arXiv:2506.16623v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) challenges robots to find objects in unseen environments, demanding sophisticated reasoning. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show potential, current ObjectNav methods often employ them superficially, primarily using vision-language embeddings for object-scene similarity checks rather than leveraging deeper reasoning. This limits contextual understanding and leads to practical issues like repetitive navigation behaviors. This paper introduces a novel zero-shot ObjectNav framework that pioneers the use of dynamic, history-aware prompting to more deeply integrate VLM reasoning into frontier-based exploration. Our core innovation lies in providing the VLM with action history context, enabling it to generate semantic guidance scores for navigation actions while actively avoiding decision loops. We also introduce a VLM-assisted waypoint generation mechanism for refining the final approach to detected objects. Evaluated on the HM3D dataset within Habitat, our approach achieves a 46% Success Rate (SR) and 24.8% Success weighted by Path Length (SPL). These results are comparable to state-of-the-art zero-shot methods, demonstrating the significant potential of our history-augmented VLM prompting strategy for more robust and context-aware robotic navigation."
