title: "Reimagining secure infrastructure for advanced AI"
description: "Securing advanced AI systems will require an evolution in infrastructure security. We’re calling for research and investment in six security measures that we believe will play key roles in protecting advanced AI.
Protecting, exploring, and applying advanced artificial intelligence (AI) is our strategic imperative. OpenAI’s mission is to deliver positive impact of advanced AI to everything from healthcare to science to education – and yes, even to cybersecurity. That work begins with building secure, trustworthy AI systems and protecting the underlying technologies from those who seek to subvert our work to cause harm."
