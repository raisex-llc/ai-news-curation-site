title: 'Low-resource Machine Translation: what for? who for? An observational study
  on a dedicated Tetun language translation service'
description: "arXiv:2411.12262v4 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Low-resource machine\
  \ translation (MT) presents a diversity of community needs and application challenges\
  \ that remain poorly understood. To complement surveys and focus groups, which tend\
  \ to rely on small samples of respondents, we propose an observational study on\
  \ actual usage patterns of tetun$.$org, a specialized MT service for the Tetun language,\
  \ which is the lingua franca in Timor-Leste. Our analysis of 100,000 translation\
  \ requests reveals patterns that challenge assumptions based on existing corpora.\
  \ We find that users, many of them students on mobile devices, typically translate\
  \ text from a high-resource language into Tetun across diverse domains including\
  \ science, healthcare, and daily life. This contrasts sharply with available Tetun\
  \ corpora, which are dominated by news articles covering government and social issues.\
  \ Our results suggest that MT systems for institutionalized minority languages like\
  \ Tetun should prioritize accuracy on domains relevant to educational contexts,\
  \ in the high-resource to low-resource direction. More broadly, this study demonstrates\
  \ how observational analysis can inform low-resource language technology development,\
  \ by grounding research in practical community needs."
