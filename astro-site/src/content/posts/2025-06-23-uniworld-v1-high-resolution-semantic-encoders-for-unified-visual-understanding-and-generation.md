title: "UniWorld-V1: High-Resolution Semantic Encoders for Unified Visual Understanding and Generation"
description: "arXiv:2506.03147v4 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Although existing unified models achieve strong performance in vision-language understanding and text-to-image generation, they remain limited in addressing image perception and manipulation -- capabilities increasingly demanded in practical applications. Recently, OpenAI introduced the powerful GPT-4o-Image model, which showcases advanced capabilities in comprehensive image perception and manipulation, sparking widespread interest. Through carefully designed experiments, we observe that GPT-4o-Image likely relies on semantic encoders rather than VAEs for feature extraction, despite VAEs being commonly regarded as crucial for image manipulation tasks. Inspired by this insight, we propose UniWorld-V1, a unified generative framework built upon semantic features extracted from powerful multimodal large language models and contrastive semantic encoders. Using only 2.7M training data, UniWorld-V1 achieves impressive performance across diverse tasks, including image understanding, generation, manipulation, and perception. We fully open-source the UniWorld-V1 framework, including model weights, training and evaluation scripts, and datasets to promote reproducibility and further research."
