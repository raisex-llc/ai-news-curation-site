title: "Grounding Language Models with Semantic Digital Twins for Robotic Planning"
description: "arXiv:2506.16493v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: We introduce a novel framework that integrates Semantic Digital Twins (SDTs) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable adaptive and goal-driven robotic task execution in dynamic environments. The system decomposes natural language instructions into structured action triplets, which are grounded in contextual environmental data provided by the SDT. This semantic grounding allows the robot to interpret object affordances and interaction rules, enabling action planning and real-time adaptability. In case of execution failures, the LLM utilizes error feedback and SDT insights to generate recovery strategies and iteratively revise the action plan. We evaluate our approach using tasks from the ALFRED benchmark, demonstrating robust performance across various household scenarios. The proposed framework effectively combines high-level reasoning with semantic environment understanding, achieving reliable task completion in the face of uncertainty and failure."
