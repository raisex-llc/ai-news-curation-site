title: "ShapeLib: Designing a library of programmatic 3D shape abstractions with Large Language Models"
description: "arXiv:2502.08884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: We present ShapeLib, the first method that leverages the priors of LLMs to design libraries of programmatic 3D shape abstractions. Our system accepts two forms of design intent: text descriptions of functions to include in the library and a seed set of exemplar shapes. We discover abstractions that match this design intent with a guided LLM workflow that first proposes, and then validates, different ways of applying and implementing functions. We learn recognition networks that map shapes to programs with these newly discovered abstractions by training on data produced by LLM authored synthetic data generation procedures. Across modeling domains (split by shape category), we find that LLMs, when thoughtfully combined with geometric reasoning, can be guided to author a library of abstraction functions that generalize to shapes outside of the seed set. This framework addresses a long-standing shape analysis problem of how to discover reusable abstraction functions while exposing interpretable, semantically aligned interfaces. We find that ShapeLib provides distinct advantages over prior alternative abstraction discovery works in terms of generalization, usability, and maintaining plausibility under manipulation. Finally, we demonstrate that ShapeLib's abstraction functions unlock a number of downstream applications, combining LLM reasoning over shape programs with geometry processing to support shape editing and generation."
