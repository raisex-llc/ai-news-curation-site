title: "Generalizable Agent Modeling for Agent Collaboration-Competition Adaptation with Multi-Retrieval and Dynamic Generation"
description: "arXiv:2506.16718v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Adapting a single agent to a new multi-agent system brings challenges, necessitating adjustments across various tasks, environments, and interactions with unknown teammates and opponents. Addressing this challenge is highly complex, and researchers have proposed two simplified scenarios, Multi-agent reinforcement learning for zero-shot learning and Ad-Hoc Teamwork. Building on these foundations, we propose a more comprehensive setting, Agent Collaborative-Competitive Adaptation (ACCA), which evaluates an agent to generalize across diverse scenarios, tasks, and interactions with both unfamiliar opponents and teammates. In ACCA, agents adjust to task and environmental changes, collaborate with unseen teammates, and compete against unknown opponents. We introduce a new modeling approach, Multi-Retrieval and Dynamic Generation (MRDG), that effectively models both teammates and opponents using their behavioral trajectories. This method incorporates a positional encoder for varying team sizes and a hypernetwork module to boost agents' learning and adaptive capabilities. Additionally, a viewpoint alignment module harmonizes the observational perspectives of retrieved teammates and opponents with the learning agent. Extensive tests in benchmark scenarios like SMAC, Overcooked-AI, and Melting Pot show that MRDG significantly improves robust collaboration and competition with unseen teammates and opponents, surpassing established baselines. Our code is available at: https://github.com/vcis-wangchenxu/MRDG.git"
