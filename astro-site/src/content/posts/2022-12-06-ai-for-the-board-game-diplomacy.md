title: "AI for the board game Diplomacy"
description: "Successful communication and cooperation have been crucial for helping societies advance throughout history. The closed environments of board games can serve as a sandbox for modelling and investigating interaction and communication – and we can learn a lot from playing them. In our recent paper, published today in Nature Communications, we show how artificial agents can use communication to better cooperate in the board game Diplomacy, a vibrant domain in artificial intelligence (AI) research, known for its focus on alliance building."
